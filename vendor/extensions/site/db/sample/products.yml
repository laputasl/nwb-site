    <p><strong>About Bruised Paws on Dogs</strong></p>
    <p>If your dog is limping, he may have a bruised, cracked or wounded paw. </p>
    <p> Help relieve your dog's obvious discomfort. Canine Heal-Care helps keep pain at bay, while cleaning infected wounds and promoting quick healing.<br /> Dogs have protective pads on their feet. These pads are subject to injury from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Thorns</li>
        <li>Broken glass</li>
        <li>Slivers</li>
        <li>Sharp rocks</li>
        <li>Burs</li>
        <li>Hot pavement</li>
        <li>People stepping on them </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Even less active, indoor dogs aren't immune to foot pad injuries. It's all too easy to step on your dog's foot accidentally. And as you as can tell from his yelp, this hurts!</p>
    <p><strong> Common Symptoms of a Bruised or Injured Dog Footpad</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Obvious pain and distress, whining</li>
        <li>Claudicating (lifting of a limb, reluctance to step on it)</li>
        <li>Red, swollen or warm-feeling pads indicate inflammation </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your dog has a wounded footpad, gently examine it carefully to see if you can find and remove the source of the injury. Keep your dog calm and encourage him to rest. This will help keep the injury from getting worse and help speed healing.</p>
    <p><strong>  Heal-Care for dog paw health</strong></p>
    <p> Apply Heal-Care directly to your dog's footpad. An all-natural ointment with a base of olive oil and beeswax, Heal-Care is loaded with Arnica and St John&rsquo;s Wort:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces pain</li>
        <li>Cleans wounds</li>
        <li>Speeds the healing process</li>
        <li>Prevents cracking</li>
        <li>Keeps footpads healthy</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Don't let your dog suffer from sore, injured paws. Order Heal-Care today!</p>
    <p> <strong>Our customers have the final word...</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;My dog Vince is sometimes a bit too &quot;gung ho&quot; for his own good. The second I let him off leash, he takes off in frantic exploration, paying no attention to potential dangers. Several times now, he's stepped on sharp objects and hurt his paws. I tried some Heal-Care last time, and it truly did wonders for him. Not only did it seem to relieve the pain, but his paws healed very quickly too. I'm going to keep a supply ready&hellip; for the next time!&quot; Carlos, Miami FL</p>

    <p>&quot;As Spike gets older, I find his paws are getting more dry and cracked. Heal-Care helps a lot though. I rub a bit into his paws every couple of days and he seems to love it.&quot; Brenda, Los Angeles CA</p>

    <p><strong>What is Cat Heart Disease?</strong></p>
    <p>Though cats don't suffer from heart attacks the way people do, other forms are heart disease are actually quite common in cats. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Heart murmurs </li>
        <li>Thickening of heart muscle </li>
        <li>Anemia </li>
        <li>High cholesterol </li>
        <li>Irregular pulse </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some of these problems stem from defects found at birth. Others are symptoms of advanced age.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Symptoms of Feline Heart Disease</strong></p>
    <p>Symptoms may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficult, labored breathing </li>
        <li>Reduced energy levels </li>
        <li>Persistent coughing </li>
        <li>Reduced weight or appetite </li>
        <li>Swelling in abdomen </li>
        <li>Discolored (blue/gray) gums </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you think your cat is suffering from heart disease, it's a good idea to consult with a veterinarian. It's easy to confuse symptoms of feline heart disease with other conditions.</p>
    <p><strong>Traditional treatments for heart disease in cats</strong></p>
    <p>As with humans, treatments may include medications like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diuretics, to control sodium levels and water retention </li>
        <li>Vasodilators to lower blood pressure </li>
        <li>Digoxin and other drugs to control heartbeat </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Natural treatment: Feline Hearty Heart</strong></p>
    <p>Hearty Heart for cats contains a special blend of herbs that have been used for centuries to promote circulatory health:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strengthens a cat's heart </li>
        <li>Helps cat resist parasites and disease </li>
        <li>Maintains cat's youthful vitality </li>
        <li>Excellent for overall health </li>
        <li>Safe for long-term use </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hearty Heart can be used alone, or in combination with traditional treatments as part of a total health plan. </p>
    <p>You can also help promote a healthy heart in your cat by ensuring she eats well and does not become obese. (Obesity is closely linked to heart and circulatory problems.) </p>
    <p>Daily use of Hearty Heart for Cats is highly recommended. One of our most popular products for re-orders, Hearty Heart is much loved by our customers&hellip; and their cats!</p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;It is with great sadness that I put my best friend to sleep on 2/28/07. TJ was diagnosed with a high 5 heart murmur (6 is fatal) in Sept of 2006, and the vet said he had two months. I did a lot of homework on this defect, and began him on your products in October. I sincerely believe that your products gave us an additional 3 months with him. Every time I took him in for a re-check, the vet was amazed at his quality of life and told me not to change anything I was doing (I don't think he trusts anything other than traditional drug therapy), but was open to me experimenting.&quot;<br />Sam</p>
    <p>&quot;Please send me two more bottles of Heart Heart for Cats. I've had Twister on it for three months now, and I'm very impressed at how much it has improved her activity level.&quot; Sian, Orlando FL</p>

    <p>If your cat has cancer, the best way to handle it is to take action. Learn all you can about your cat's form of cancer. Find out how to give her the best possible care.</p>
    <p>We suggest you talk to your vet about the various treatments available. For some types of cancers, conventional treatments are quite effective.</p>

    <p>Our Cancer Fighting Kit is an essential part of any treatment plan for cat cancer. Containing both ES Clear and NuPet Feline Granular Greens, our Cancer Fighting Kit will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give your cat the best possible chance of beating cancer</li>
        <li>Keep your cat as comfortable and pain-free as possible</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What is ES Clear for Cat Cancer?</strong></p>
    <p>ES clear was formulated by a leading naturopathic vet. The herbs in ES Clear have been used for centuries in traditional medicine. They have been show to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slow the growth of cancerous tumors</li>
        <li>Reduce or prevent the spread of cancer to surrounding cells</li>
        <li>Strengthen a cat's immune system</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> What are Nu-Pet Feline Granular Greens</strong></p>
    <p>Granular Greens are an excellent companion product for ES Clear. This grouping of grasses, antioxidants and vitamins:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Help to protect against free radicals that can cause cellular damage to your cat</li>
        <li> Ensure that your cat's diet is supplemented in the time when her body needs it the most</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Will the cancer-fighting kit cure my cat's cancer?</strong></p>
    <p>There is no sure-fire cure for cancer, in cats or in humans. So for us to claim that this kit will cure your cat's cancer would be irresponsible.</p>

    <p>&quot;My cat has cancer. I was planning to have her put down as soon as she started showing signs of pain, so she wouldn't have to suffer. About two months ago, I thought it was getting close. She didn't seem to be hurting exactly, but she was very low in energy. I decided I had nothing to loose by trying your cancer-fighting kit, and I'm really glad I did. My cat's energy levels have gone way up. She's eating again, and back to her old self. I know she's not &quot;cured&quot; exactly, but at least she's much more comfortable.&quot; Nicole, Lakeview CA</p>

    <p>&quot;I have a sweet Tom named (wait for it) Tom! Unfortunately, he has liver cancer. About a year ago, the vet only gave him a few months to live. I thought I owed it to Tom to give him the best chance possible. It was the least I could do considering the years of joy he's given me! I started Tom on your cancer fighting kit, and a year later he's still hanging in there. In fact, he still seems happy and playful. Thank you for this wonderful product.&quot; Connie, Oliver BC</p>

    \t\t<strong><font color=\"006666\">Description</font></strong><br>\r\n          It is a dogs natural instinct to be with a pack. As the dog\xE2\x80\x99s \r\n          owner, you are part of the pack, and perhaps the pack consists of just \r\n          you and your dog. When you leave, your dog may become very upset, and \r\n          make this known by destroying furniture, scratching doors, and ruining \r\n          your favorite pair of shoes. These are signs of separation anxiety, \r\n          which may be experienced by up to 15% of the canine population. Some \r\n          times this is just a display of bad behavior, but if your dog barks \r\n          excessively, soils the floor even though house trained, attempts to \r\n          escape, loses their appetite or becomes inactive, then it is more likely \r\n          they are acting out because they suffer from separation anxiety disorder. \r\n          <br>\r\n          <br>\r\n          To remedy this, change your pattern before leaving so that you dog can \r\n          learn new behavior when you leave. Take them for a nice long walk before \r\n          you leave, so that it\xE2\x80\x99s associated with something positive. It \r\n          will also tire the dog so that they may spend most of the time sleeping \r\n          while you\xE2\x80\x99re away. Also start by taking short trips away, a minute \r\n          or two, and work up to a longer time so that your dog learns that you \r\n          will be returning. Using these methods should help your dog gain confidence \r\n          to know that you love them as much as they love you, and keep your favorite \r\n          pair of shoes out of harms way. \r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p><strong><font color=\"006666\">Ingredients</font></strong><br>\r\n        Chamomile: Contains volatile oils (Alpha-bisabolol), flavonoids (chamazulene) \r\n        and lactones (matricarin, matricine) with anti-inflammatory action.

    <p>&quot;Socrates would pant all night long. I could tell he was miserable and that made me miserable. He couldn't rest. I did research on the Internet and came across your website. Figuring I had nothing to lose, I ordered your product. After I got in the habit of putting in his food twice a day, I was and still am amazed at the results. NO MORE PANTING AT ALL! I have told numerous people about this product including my vet so she can tell her other clients about your product. I would recommend this product highly to anyone who has a pet with a heart condition. Thanks so much. Vicki Brown, Gainesville GA&quot;</p>

    <p><strong>What is Canine Arthritis?</strong><br />Dogs frequently suffer from arthritis. If your pet has this disease, his joints will become inflamed (swollen) and painful as the cartilage and connective tissues of his joints slowly break down. </p>
    <p>Warning signs that your dog is suffering from arthritis include a reluctance to stand up or climb stairs. Other telltale signs of canine arthritis include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your dog favors one side of his body </li>
        <li>Limping, especially when he first gets up </li>
        <li>Swollen joints (especially the hips) </li>
        <li>Reduced appetite </li>
        <li>Aversion to being touched or petted </li>
        <li>Your dog loses interest in activities he previously enjoyed: running, swimming, playing, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Large breeds of dogs tend to suffer from arthritis more often than smaller breeds. This is probably due simply to the extra weight and stress on the joints of larger breeds. What&rsquo;s less clear is why purebred dogs &ndash; particularly males &ndash; suffer from canine arthritis more often than mixed breeds.</p>
    <p>There&rsquo;s no way to entirely eliminate the risk of canine arthritis. But as a pet owner, you can reduce the risk (or severity) by ensuring your dog gets plenty of regular exercise, without overdoing it. This will help keep your dog&rsquo;s joints healthy and well lubricated. It&rsquo;ll also keep him from becoming overweight, which tends to make matters worse. </p>
    <p>A good diet is also important in keeping canine arthritis under control. In particular, too much protein can lead to problems.</p>
    <p>There is no cure for arthritis in dogs, but there are good treatments. Taken orally, Canine Old Timer is very effective in reducing pain and inflammation in the joints. It also has powerful restorative properties.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kidney problems</span> are among the top causes of illness and death in older cats. Just as the heart often causes problems for older humans &ndash; and the liver often causes problems in older dogs &ndash; the kidneys seem to be the feline &ldquo;weak spot&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>Two common types of cat kidney problems are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chronic renal (kidney) failure </li>
        <li>Kidney stones </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Renal (kidney) failure, as its name implies, is when the kidney fails to do its job, which is to concentrate the urine and cleanse the blood. </p>
    <p>Renal failure can be acute or chronic. Acute kidney failure is usually the result of a cat drinking a toxin. If the cat survives the initial trauma, it is often reversible. Chronic kidney failure sneaks up more gradually.</p>
    <p>Common Symptoms of feline renal (kidney) disease:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased frequency of urination </li>
        <li>Presence of blood in the urine </li>
        <li>Loss of appetite </li>
        <li>Poor coat </li>
        <li>Depression and/or vomiting </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Kidney stones are mineral deposits that from in a cat&rsquo;s kidneys. They irritate the bladder lining and can even block a cat&rsquo;s urinary tract, causing pain and difficulty in urination. </p>
    <p>Poor diet, including high sodium (salt) intake is one cause of kidney stones. Pets that have excessive mineral content in the diet are more likely to be affected.</p>
    <p><strong>Treating kidney disease in cats<br /></strong>If your cat is suffering from any form of kidney disease, you should see your vet to discuss conventional treatment options. These include intravenous fluid treatment, dialysis (artificial blood filtering), various drugs, and even kidney transplants. </p>
    <p>Also be sure to ensure your cat is getting plenty of fresh water. Put your cat on a low sodium diet. A reduced protein diet is often recommended too.</p>
    <p><strong>Natural, herbal treatment for kidney disease in cats: <br /></strong>Tripsy for cat kidney disease is very effective, especially in combination with traditional treatments. Tripsy contains a powerful combination of herbal extracts proven to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Promote healthy kidney functioning </li>
        <li>Fight kidney infections </li>
        <li>Improve urinary flow </li>
        <li>Reduce the pain and discomfort of kidney stones </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Doctor-formulated and vet-approved<br /></strong>Painstakingly formulated by a leading naturopathic veterinarian, Tripsy is one of our best-loved products. It is highly effective, yet totally natural and 100% safe for long-term use.</p>
    <p>Your cat will look and feel much better&hellip; quickly! </p>

    <p><strong>Our customers have the final word...</strong><br />Hello!&nbsp; I am SO HAPPY to have heard about your product!&nbsp; Being told your pet is &quot;dying of acute adrenal failure&quot; following a blood test can be devastating.&nbsp; Thank God I went to the internet for more info and up popped Tripsy!&nbsp;&nbsp; Albert&nbsp; (my seven year old cat) is doing just fine.&nbsp; He has gained weight, and continues to have a healthy appetite.

    <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Testimonial<br /></strong>I purchased Tripsy for my sixteen year old cat,Calico. The vet said that she was in kidney failure, and that she would need subQ treatments twice a day for the rest of her life. Within a week of beginning Tripsy I was able to wean her off of SubQ. She now takes two doses of Tripsy per day. Calico is back to her old self: purring, grooming, and she has a shiny coat. I am so glad that I found your website. Thank you for offering such a wonderful product! I do have a question. The bottle is rather large, and I am afraid that it will expire before it is all used. Can Tripsy be safely frozen? </font></p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial<br /></strong>&ldquo;All my life I have had cats but before now, none of them have had kidney disease. My current cat, Brit, is a kind, gentle animal who was recently diagnosed with kidney disease. Being a bit of a health food, natural product, environmentally aware kind of girl, my first thought was to seek out some natural products to give to Brit. After a brief search I came across Tripsy on your website. After reading the details and potential benefits I decided this was what I was looking for. I was right! It worked like a charm and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough. Brit is picking up nicely and that tells me Tripsy worked!&rdquo;</p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Hi, about a year ago we turned to you for help for our cat Buster who just recently celebrated his 20th Birthday. My friend Gisela firmly believes that your Hearty Heart and Tripsy helped him a lot and he is much better now than a year ago. I just want to thank you and I'm sending to you a couple of pictures of him eating a tomato (happen to like tomatoes).&quot;<br />Ms. Genis-New York</p>
    <p>We just received this nice picture from our regular customer in New York. Her cat, Buster has been using our Tripsy and Hearty Heart for a year and he is doing great!! Buster just celebrated his 20th birthday and we would like to say &quot; Happy Birthday, Buster!!&quot;</p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;I just want to say thanks for such a wonderful supplement. Dickens was diagnosed last October, 2007 with chronic kidney disease and his lab results were not very good. I took him to the vet's and left him there for intravenous therapy for three days, they force-fed him by inserting a tube in his throat for the duration of his stay. When I got him home he was so sick I was pretty worried that he may not have a long time left and what time he did have I wondered what the quality would be like. I started to force feed him myself by putting his special diet food on my thumb and pushing it up onto the roof of his mouth. He allowed me to do this several times a day a little each time. I decided that since he was not a huge fan of this process that I would feed him twice a day. He started to pick up and then finally your product arrived and he has steadfastly improved. He eats on his own but I still feel more comfortable making sure that he has enough in him so I continue to feed him once a day, maybe twice if he has only picked at his food. He is happy and so am I, so again, Thanks!<br />Sharon&quot;</p>

    <p><strong>More Testimonials</strong><br />&quot;When I received the diagnosis I researched it and found Tripsy on your site and read good things about it. Since I've started her on Tripsy she has been doing very well.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Boots was in decline until I started him on the Tripsy medication. It extended his life for approx. 1 year, but the disease continued to advance and he passed away 3 weeks ago. I am still very appreciative of the extra time this medication allowed us to spend with him, before he went off to cat heaven.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;With the daily dose of Tripsy along with sub-q fluids (Ringer's 2-3X/week), the quality of Julie's life was improved and supported to the extent that she lived nearly a year longer than the veterinarian projected as possible. Until the night before she died, Julie was interested in her surroundings, her four-legged buddies, and food...esp. tunafish. I'm just grateful for all the time we had with her.&quot;</p>

    <p><strong>Skullcap (Scutellaria Baicalensis):</strong>  Skullcap is a perennial herb native to Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia and northern China and has been used in traditional Asian medicine for at least 2000 years.  A highly valued herb, Skullcap has been reported to kill bacteria and viruses and is used to help alleviate symptoms of allergies, asthma, anxiety and arteriosclerosis. </p>
    <p><strong>Fu Ling (Scierotium Poriae Cocos):</strong>  Fu Ling, also called China Root, is a Chinese herb used to promote healthy body fluids by regulating water through its ability to drain dampness by promoting urination.  Through proper fluid retention, this herb also has been known to reduce swelling.  It can help to tonify the spleen Qi and aide in lethargy and low appetite issues.</p>
    <p><strong>Ginseng (Panax Ginseng):</strong> Ginseng Root is a perennial plant rarely found to grow wild.  These crops are labor intensive because this plant takes four years to mature in order to be cultivated.  Ginseng has many medicinal uses and was traditionally used to curb emotions, stop agitation, enlighten the mind and increase wisdom.  Today it is valued to improve many different health related issues and is commonly used to improve cognitive abilities.  Studies have shown Ginseng can help to improve memory, attention, concentration and the general ability to cope. </p>
    <p><strong>Ginkgo (Ginkgo Biloba):</strong> Ginkgo extract is taken from the leaves of the Ginkgo tree.  The Ginkgo Biloba tree is one of the oldest species of trees dating back to over 300 million years and its extract, Ginkgo, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 5000 years.  Used for various health conditions, Ginkgo is widely known to increase the body&rsquo;s production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the compound and main source for energy at the cellular level.  By increasing internal cell energy, this herb can boost the brain&rsquo;s metabolism of glucose for energy and can also increase electrical activity.  Ginkgo works to promote blood flow to the brain and helps to elevate the brains oxygen levels.  By feeding the brain with its essential flavonoids, synaptic transmissions can improve and promote healthy thought processes like increased memory, mental sharpness and concentration.  Ginkgo root has also been reported to help curb depression and increase coping skills in daily life. </p>
    <p><strong>Gui Zhi (Ramulus Cinnamomi Cassiae):</strong> Gui Zhi also known as Cinnamon Twig.  Cinnamon, used in cooking and baking is cultivated from a tropical evergreen tree native to regions in India.  The reddish brown bark and twigs of this evergreen is known to feed the body by promoting the healthy flow of blood.</p>

    <p>Living with memory loss, anxiety and scattered concentration is frustrating, for both the affected individual as well as family members, friends and teachers.  Learning about the brain and its highly complicated functions can serve as a guide to understanding how to overcome this challenging bio-chemical weakness.</p>
    <p><strong>How the body works in conjunction with the brain</strong></p>
    <p>Scientific studies suggest that in order to focus on outside information, some brain regions are activated, while others are inhibited.  This automatic coordination of brain function fails when memory loss or cognitive thinking is not functioning properly.  These types of brain processes that &ldquo;hiccup&rdquo; are often diagnosed as; ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder, recognized to be difficulty in learning, hyperactivity and/or impaired judgment.  Symptoms can also include, inability to focus or complete tasks, forgetfulness, restless fidgeting, excessive talking or interrupting and difficulty with organizational skills.  Another diagnosis primarily given to children is ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, where constant motion and disruptive behavior are present.</p>
    <p>Studies have found a common thread that runs through all forms of ADD/ADHD whether mild or severe symptoms are present.  The shared issue is that the brain is unable to coordinate the switching of its different regions within itself to process incoming information properly.  Like a train that&rsquo;s running on one track needs to switch tracks to get to its destination, the brain needs to switch its regions at lightening speed to function correctly.  In order for the brain to switch its regions, it relies on a tiny area called the locus ceruleus.  The locus ceruleus transmits information via chemical messengers called norepinephrines.  If anything goes wrong during this chemical transmission, anywhere in the pathways the norepinephrines travel, ADD or ADHD can result.</p>
    <p><strong>Causes of ADD/ADHD symptoms</strong></p>
    <p> The causes of ADD/ADHD vary widely. For some it could be a genetic issue deeply rooted in their neurological pathways.  In many cases, the causes are more environmental and can be attributed to diet, lifestyle, chemical imbalances, toxin overload and even allergies.  Issues that can also lead to ADD and ADHD include neurological problems in the brain, oxygen deprivation at birth, anxiety, family history, lead poisoning, diet, and smoking by the mother during pregnancy. </p>
    <p>Studies have shown that the consumption of sugar impedes the brain&rsquo;s ability to respond to its norephinephrines, the chemical it needs in order to filter and process outside information.  Other studies have reported that allergies which cause inflammation can lead to a sensory overload, where the brain receives too much information and cannot process it properly. </p>
    <p><strong>Individual people&mdash;Individual symptoms</strong></p>
    <p> ADD/ADHD and related conditions are &quot;spectrum disorders&quot; which means the symptoms vary widely. Some suffer mild symptoms and might only have difficulty paying attention. Others can suffer terrible bouts of hyperactivity and memory loss as they bounce off the walls and explode in anger. </p>
    <p><strong>Western Medicine and its approach to ADD/ADHD</strong></p>
    <p> The first choice by western allopathic medicine is to prescribe psycho-stimulant or anti-depressant drugs.  Stimulant drugs used in excess can actually cause depression and lethargy.  The overuse of anti-depressant drugs can also have an adverse effect known as a &ldquo;rebound effect&rdquo; where anger and frustration reappear.  The truth is, these potentially dangerous drugs do nothing to address ADD/ADHD's root causes. They have a high risk of addiction and frequently cause profound side effects with zero long-term benefit to an individual&rsquo;s overall health.<br /> <br /> <strong style="font-weight: bold;">The Natural Approach to </strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reducing Hyperactivity &amp; Attention Problems</span></p>
    <p>The natural approach is gentle and takes a holistic view of the individual.  It considers diet, lifestyle, personality type and environment.  Alternative medicine helps individuals combine a healthy lifestyle with a healthy diet including reduced sugar consumption and the elimination of stimulants.  Herbal remedies strive to help the body reach an improved state of overall health to alleviate symptoms and don&rsquo;t have side effects or the same potentially harmful risks that prescription drugs have.</p>
    <p><strong>Concentration Essentials&mdash;The Natural Choice</strong></p>
    <p> Concentration Essentials is an all natural, non-addictive choice that can help alleviate the symptoms of ADD/ADHD. It is a safe and effective herbal remedy, painstakingly developed by a leading naturopathic doctor. Concentration Essentials has been used for years to control the symptoms of ADD/ADHD. This is not a new product and Naturopathic doctors have been using this formula for 3 decades. It is an extremely effective option for people who don't want to use harsh prescription drugs and are searching for a natural way to treat the symptoms related to ADD/ADHD. </p>
    <h4>Frequently-Asked Questions</h4>
    <p><strong>1. What's it like to suffer from ADD/ADHD?</strong></p>
    <p>People with mild symptoms tend to be easily bored and incapable of keeping their mind on tasks.  For individuals that suffer with severe symptoms, it can be like living in a whirlwind of sounds, thoughts and images.  Some are easily distracted by unimportant sounds and events with a mind that constantly shifts from one thought to the next. For many they simply can't sit still, cannot plan ahead and rarely finish what they start.  Often a person&rsquo;s mind is so wrapped up in a kaleidoscope of thoughts and images that they don't even notice when someone is talking to them. </p>
    <p><strong>2. What causes ADD/ADHD?</strong></p>
    <p>In many cases, the causes are more environmental and can be attributed to diet, lifestyle, chemical imbalances, toxin overload and even allergies.  Issues that can also lead to ADD and ADHD include neurological problems in the brain, oxygen deprivation at birth, anxiety, family history, lead poisoning, diet and smoking by the mother during pregnancy.  Some studies have shown that the consumption of sugar is a leading contributor to ADD/ADHD symptoms.  Allergies that cause inflammation and stimulants that overload the brain are also contributing factors. </p>
    <p><strong>3. How common is ADD/ADHD in children?</strong></p>
    <p>In North America ADHD is the most common neurological disorder and affects an estimated 5% of school-aged children.  ADD and ADHD have been found to run in families.  It&rsquo;s been reported that boys with ADHD outnumber girls by at least a three to one margin. </p>
    <p><strong>4. Can adults suffer from ADD/ADHD too?</strong></p>
    <p>Adults can suffer the symptoms of ADD/ADHD.  Undiagnosed children grow up and over the years usually learn some type of coping mechanism.  Now older, these still undiagnosed adults are termed to have Residual ADD or Adult ADD/ADHD.  The term ADD/ADHD alone is used by medical clinicians for youngsters.  Studies have shown an estimated 4 percent of adults have Residual ADD.<br />     <br />     <strong>5.  Is ADD/ADHD reversible?</strong></p>
    <p>Every person&rsquo;s body has a genetic code within their cellular structure.  Like a finger print, a person&rsquo;s genetic code is unique to them and only their body.  For adults and children who suffer the symptoms of ADD/ADHD there is hope.  By not allowing outside influences like; bacteria and allergies, chemicals and toxins, stimulants and drugs, as well as, dangerous dietary foods like sugars, preservatives and toxic foods that contain chemicals, adults and children can control how their body reacts, functions and behaves.  Looking at the entire body from a Holistic view, there may be a tendency in a person&rsquo;s genetic code that leans towards ADD/ADHD.  Stabilizing the body and its internal/external environment makes it possible to recover and lead a productive symptom free life.  In combination with good health, proper diet and toxic free living conditions, its possible to discourage the onset or continuation of ADD/ADHD.  By avoiding the issues that set the body into motion to experience neurological dysfunction, a person chooses to keep their body in a safety zone.  The addition of natural supplements that can help support the body is key to making this safety zone a reality zone. </p>
    <p><strong>6. What does Concentration Essentials do and how does it work?</strong></p>
    <p>Concentration Essentials has been painstakingly formulated by Naturopathic physicians as a whole body approach to alleviating the symptoms of ADD/ADHD.

    <p><strong>Revivogen Scalp Therapy Formula &amp; Bio-Cleansing shampoo &ndash; Anti DHT Treatment for Hair Loss</strong></p>
    <p>Hair loss and thinning hair have been sensitive issues for both men and women throughout time. Recently, medical science has identified the main cause of hair loss. It is now a known medical fact that hair loss stems from both genetic and hormonal causes.</p>
    <p>In the vast majority of cases, hair loss &ndash; in both men and women &ndash; is caused by a hormonal byproduct called DHT (dihydrotestostrone). Under the suppressive effects of DHT, the hair follicles become thinner and finer until the hair is permanently lost.</p>
    <p>Revivogen products contain active ingredients which block DHT production and its destructive effects on hair follicles</p>
    <p><strong>What treatments are available to fight hair loss?</strong></p>
    <p>Chemical Treaments</p>
    <p>Propecia&reg; is a FDA approved synthetic medication available only to men by prescription. It works by reducing DHT levels, however, Propecia&reg; although effective, may be associated with a wide range of side effects (including impotence) and cannot be used by women.</p>
    <p>Natural treatments</p>
    <p>Revivogen is a natural topical formula, which works through the same mechanism as Propecia&reg;. Revivogen is made with natural ingredients that have been scientifically proven to reduce DHT production. In fact, the active ingredients in Revivogen reduce DHT even more effectively than Propecia&reg;. In addition these ingredients prevent DHT's attachment to the hair follicle, which is not done by Propecia&reg;.</p>
    <p>By reducing DHT's production and its destructive effects on the hair follicle, the weakened and miniaturized hairs become thicker and stronger again, leading to a fuller and healthier head of hair. By targeting the cause of hair loss at the molecular level, Revivogen's powerful natural ingredients revitalize and protect the hair, blocking the androgen receptor and stimulating hair growth.</p>

    <p><strong>Indications and Usage</strong></p>
    <p>Revivogen Scalp Therapy Formula</p>
    <p>The main active ingredients in this Revivogen formula have been scientifically proven to reduce the production of DHT by blocking the activity of the enzyme, 5 alpha reductase. This enzyme converts testosterone to DHT and is present in the hair follicles and scalp at high levels. Other ingredients block the androgen receptors and stimulate hair growth.</p>
    <p>By blocking the activity of the 5 alpha reductase and lowering the concentration of DHT in the scalp, Revivogen helps to revitalize and protect the hair follicle. This is a topical formula, which ensures the concentration of the active ingredients at the hair follicle where DHT is produced without the systemic side effects.</p>
    <p>Revivogen Bio-Cleansing Shampoo</p>
    <p>The shampoo contains the main active ingredients found in the topical formula and complements its activity, but is not effective by itself. The Bio-Cleansing Shampoo gently cleanses the scalp and removes sebum and DHT from the scalp. Important bio-active nutrients nourish, moisturize and improve the hair and scalp condition, creating a healthy environment for hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>Track record</strong></p>
    <p>Within six to eight weeks of using Revivogen you can expect a significant decrease in hair loss and appreciate a difference in how your hair looks and feels. With continued use, the hair quality will continue to improve and stay healthy with best results occurring after twelve to eighteen months. Once the desired results are achieved, continued use of Revivogen is needed to maintain the revitalized hair.</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonials</strong></p>

Their pet will often single out men, children or those with \r\n      a certain characteristic such as men with beards, or women with large hats. \r\n      This is due to negative experiences during the sensitive first weeks and \r\n      months of the dog\xE2\x80\x99s life. Men and children also tend to have the most \r\n      negative or aggression behavior towards dogs, which is why they in return \r\n      tend to be more aggressive to these two demographics. \r\n      <p>Select breed or lack of socialization with other dogs and people are \r\n        some causes of fear aggression. Sometimes dogs are simply aggressive because \r\n        they are in discomfort or pain, so it is always best to first have your \r\n        dog checked out by your vet, especially if aggression is an unusual characteristic \r\n        for your beloved friend. If you are near an aggressive dog, do not make \r\n        eye contact with the dog. Back away slowly without turning your back. \r\n        Never run as this will excite the dog further. </p>\r\n      <p>A good training exercise to desensitize your dog is to have them in a \r\n        relaxed state of mind and position and introduce a fear stimulant from \r\n        a distance. If your dog is afraid of men, have a male friend stand at \r\n        a distance from your relaxed dog. If the dog remains calm, reward them \r\n        with a treat. Have your friend step close to your dog. If the dog remain \r\n        calm reward them again. If the dog because aroused have your friend step \r\n        back to the original distance.

    <p><strong><span>About Internal Parasites</span></strong></p>
    <p><span>There are a variety of internal parasites, or worms, which can make a home inside your cat&rsquo;s body. These include roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms, and whip worms, of which roundworm is the most common in cats. Young animals are most susceptible to cat roundworms as they can be transferred to the kitten from its mother through the placenta or breast milk. Pets can also acquire the worm by ingesting contaminated feces or another small animal, such as a rodent, which has worms. </span><span>Worms</span><span> can be diagnosed through examination of a stool sample. </span></p>
    <p><span>The intestinal mucosa is the surface lining of the intestines where cells absorb nutrients. When worms attack the intestines, an animal cannot absorb these nutrients. Inulin PK fights worms by protecting the intestinal mucosa. It also helps to promote healing, regenerate damaged liver cells and increase immunity so that the animal&rsquo;s body can fight and acquire resistance to the parasite. </span></p>
    <p><strong><span>Common Symptoms of Worms</span></strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><span>Anemia and poor weight-gain </span></li>
        <li><span>Apathy </span></li>

    <p><strong>Milk Thistle for cats: Nature&rsquo;s treatment for liver disease </strong></p>
    <p>Milk Thistle is a highly effective herbal remedy, well-known as an effective treatment for liver disease in cats, dogs and humans alike. It has no equivalent in conventional medicine. </p>
    <p>The active ingredient in Feline Milk Thistle is called silymarin. It effectively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevents toxins from binding to the cat&rsquo;s liver </li>
        <li>Helps the cat&rsquo;s liver to regenerate </li>
        <li>Scavenges free radicals </li>
        <li>Stabilizes liver membranes </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Milk Thistle also stimulates the production of new liver cells in cats, replacing damaged cells. It is an excellent restorative, any time your cat is ill. It supports her liver and helps her recovery. As an anti-oxidant, silymarin is even more effective than vitamin E.</p>
    <p>Feline Milk Thistle helps combat the toxic side effects of drugs like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chemotherapy drugs </li>
        <li>Chemical heartworm medications </li>
        <li>Antibiotics </li>
        <li>Corticosteroids </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An all natural, herbal product, feline milk thistle is safe for long-term use.</p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong><br />&quot;I just wanted to say Thank You from the bottom of my heart. My precious little &ldquo;girl&rdquo; Sabrina suffers from chronic hepatitis, and her vet stressed that giving her milk thistle would help her a lot. We tried giving her pills, but that didn't work out at all. I happened upon your website about 6 weeks ago and ordered liquid milk thistle your company offered. Not only was it much easier to administer, but I just received the results of Sabrina&rsquo;s recent blood work. It&rsquo;s nothing short of a miracle! Her blood count numbers, while I don&rsquo;t know exactly what each means went from 2290 down to 278!!! Another count went from 812 to 159! I cannot tell you how grateful I am for this product. Again, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart.&quot;<br />Sincerely, <br />Ann Ponchak </p>

    <p><strong>Customer testimonial</strong><br />&ldquo;My cat Freddie is so cool. He has huge amounts of energy, a great personality and the cutest little face. I always know when Freddie is ill and the most recent time it was worse than I thought as he had liver disease. The vet gave me various treatments for Freddie and I also looked for some kind of natural supplement which someone told me was a good idea too. Milk Thistle was what they were talking about. Soon after ordering, it arrived and I started administering it to Freddie. I am not kidding you, I really noticed the difference. Freddie is well on his way to good health and I just wanted to say thanks and encourage anyone else who has a cat with liver disease to try Milk Thistle&rdquo;<br />Janet - Paducah, KY</p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">About Dog Kidney Disease</span><br /><br />In humans, the heart is the organ most likely to cause health problems as we age. In dogs, it&rsquo;s the kidneys. Nobody is quite sure why, but kidney problems are among the top causes of illness and death in older dogs. Two common types of dog kidney problems are:
    <ul>
        <li>Chronic renal (kidney) failure </li>
        <li>Kidney stones </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Renal (kidney) failure</strong>, as its name implies, is when the kidney fails to do its job, which is to filter impurities out of the blood and concentrate the urine. <em>Acute</em> kidney failure is often the result of ingesting toxins, and is sometimes reversible. <em>Chronic</em> kidney failure sneaks up more gradually, and is a leading cause of death in dogs. </p>
    <p>Kidney stones are mineral deposits that from in a dog&rsquo;s kidneys. They irritate the bladder lining and can even block a dog&rsquo;s urinary tract. </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Treating kidney disease in dogs</p>
    <p>If your dog is suffering from any form of kidney disease, you should see your vet to discuss conventional treatment options. These include intravenous fluid treatment, dialysis (artificial blood filtering), various drugs, and even kidney transplants. </p>
    <p>Also be sure to put your dog on a low sodium diet, as high blood pressure often accompanies kidney failure. A reduced protein diet is often recommended as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Natural, herbal treatment: Tripsy</strong> for dog kidney disease is particularly helpful, especially in combination with traditional treatments. Tripsy contains a powerful combination of herbal extracts proven to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Promote healthy kidney functioning </li>
        <li>Fight kidney infections </li>
        <li>Improve urinary flow </li>
        <li>Reduce the pain and discomfort of kidney stones </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tripsy is high effective, yet is totally natural and 100% safe for long-term use.</p>
    <p><strong>Doctor-formulated and vet-approved</strong><br />Tripsy was painstakingly formulated by a leading naturopathic veterinarian. It is gentle yet effective, without adverse side effects. Don't let your dog suffer any longer. Order Tripsy today.</p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the final word..</strong><br />&quot;I am writing to let you know how grateful my family and I are for the Tripsy product we recently got from your website. Our dog Larry is a real member of our family and the kids absolutely love him. Naturally, it is important to keep him healthy.</p>
    <p>When Larry was recently diagnosed with kidney disease, it really upset us all. The kids were distraught and thought he would die. After the vet treated him with a fluid therapy, we were put on to Tripsy and hoped it would help in his healing process. As the last few weeks have passed, Larry has been getting better, looking better and even the vet is pleased with his condition. It is great to know that Larry will be himself again. Thank you from us all.&quot;<br />&mdash;Liz, Boston, MA</p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;I did want to Thank You So Much, I am an avid believer in natural remedies for all of my pets. I was at my wits end with my Abracadabra, my faithful 13 year old Shepherd. She was having such difficulty with Kidney Stones, I tried everything the Vet had me to do for her, other than helping her infections from passing the stones and providing some special diet food for her problem, Tripsy was the only thing that helped her, and within a few days. <br /><br />She also had a brief time where she was trying to pass a stone and I started her up on the Tripsy formula and within days she was able to pass her stone and back to her old self. I even told the Vet that they should look into carrying this item in their hospital.<br /><br />I am very grateful, and I was wondering do you think that Tripsy might be able to help some of these pets that were affected by the horrible food incident that has touched so many pets and pet owners?&quot;<br />&mdash;Kindest, Warmest Regards, Rhonda in Las Vegas</p>
    <p><img height="170" width="170" alt="dog kindey disease" src="/UserFiles/Image/bubba_sSa.jpg" /><br /><br />P.S. I have attached a picture of Abracadabra with one of my cats named Bubba.</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;I just want to tell you that my dog Maggie (16 years old) had been sick for about 6 months before I found out about Tripsy. She was diagnosed with kidney disease and was placed on fluids every day. She had good days and bad days, but mostly bad. She wasn't eating, vomiting frequently, having accidents, trembling and had seizures one evening. I thought it was about time to put her to rest until I heard about the Tripsy (which I thought would be a sham since I'm not really into holistic medicine).</p>
    <p>After about one week on Tripsy I started to notice a difference. Although she's still not 100%, she seems to feel much better. She's still not eating much and is as skinny as a rail, but she isn't shaking anymore, isn't vomiting (only about once a month), and even has the energy to play sometimes. She still gets her daily dose of fluid in addition to her Tripsy (which I give her twice a day).</p>
    <p>Thanks a lot guys! I think you've made the quality of life for my Maggie a lot better!&quot;<br />&mdash;Debbie</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;My poodle has been on Tripsy for two weeks now and we have seen such a wonderful improvement. She was on death&rsquo;s door when we first started giving it to her. She would not eat and didn't want to move around anymore. Now she walks out to use the washroom like normal and she has gained her appetite back. Thank you so much for Tia's second chance.&quot;<br />&mdash;Lori in Ocala, FL</p>

    <p><strong>Living with Prostate Problems</strong></p>
    <p>Are you a male who&rsquo;s experiencing problems such as frequent urination, inability to control urine flow, burning sensations, and frequent bathroom visits through the night? You may be having problems with your prostate. It&rsquo;s a gland that&rsquo;s unique to the male anatomy. It also causes difficulties for many men, as they get older. In fact, problems become very common after the age of 50. Enlargement of the prostate, or prostate hyperplasia, happens to about 80% - 90% of men at some point in their lifetimes. While many men do worry that this will mean they are contracting prostate cancer, most of the problems they will face are far less serious. What&rsquo;s more, having any of these problems will not increase the possibilities of getting prostate cancer.</p>
    <p> Nevertheless, issues with your prostate are, at the very least, an annoying nuisance. Happily, many of them can be addressed relatively easily. It is vitally important, however, that any man experiencing these symptoms makes an appointment with his doctor so that all necessary tests can be carried out.</p>
    <p> We think it&rsquo;s also important to be aware of, and care for, this gland in order to reduce the possibilities of illness, That&rsquo;s why naturalwellbeing.com believes that you should take the time to understand what the prostate is, what it does, and some of the things that can go wrong with it. With your prostate, as with all other health issues, prevention is the best cure.</p>
    <p> <strong>Prostate Function and Men&rsquo;s Health</strong></p>
    <p> The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that exists to produce a liquid that&rsquo;s added to male semen. This liquid protects the sperm from the natural acidity in the vagina, increasing the chances of conception during intercourse. In the body, the prostate gland is positioned so that it wraps around the urinary tract. It grows larger as men age and, if it gets too large, it can cause health problems.</p>
    <p> Those problems are basically divided into three categories, which, problematically, all exhibit many of the same symptoms. Problems can usually be traced to either prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or prostate cancer.</p>
    <p> <strong>Prostatitis</strong></p>
    <p> This is most common to men under the age of 50.  The main symptom is a burning feeling during urination, or the need to urinate more often. It probably means that the prostate is inflamed or irritated. It may also just mean that you have a fever or are tired. If the prostate is inflamed, it&rsquo;s usually because it is fighting germs or a bacteria. Acute prostatitis is a bacterial infection that can cause chills, fever and pain in the lower back. Chronic bacterial prostatitis is an infection that comes back again and again. It can be extremely difficult to treat. Lastly, chronic abacterial prostatitis occurs most commonly in young to middle-aged men. It causes painful sensations at the tip of the penis, between the legs, or in the lower back. It&rsquo;s also very hard to treat.</p>
    <p> <strong>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)</strong></p>
    <p> BPH is most common in men over 50. It is, basically, an excessively enlarged prostate squeezing on the urethra and affecting bladder control. Difficulty starting urination, a weak urine stream &ndash; even when you need to go frequently, and small amount of blood in the urine, are all symptoms. These are also symptoms of prostate cancer, so it&rsquo;s important to see your doctor if you experience them. Although the relationship is not fully understood, BPH is also linked to sexual dysfunction in some men. Erectile dysfunction, discomfort or pain during ejaculation, and decreased libido have all been reported by men with BPH.</p>
    <p> <strong>Prostate Cancer</strong></p>
    <p> This is one of the slowest growing form of cancers, and may develop without producing any symptoms. This is why annual checkups for men over 50 are so important. Early detection and treatment have an extremely high success rate.</p>
    <p> <strong>Maintaining And Enhancing Prostate Health</strong></p>
    <p> Given the wide range of possible prostate problems that men can face, and their frequency, creating and maintaining a healthy prostate is obviously important. So is doing everything possible to treat and eliminate problems when they develop. One way to do this is to treat not just the symptoms, but also the gland itself holistically. By supporting and enhancing the natural function of the prostate, problems can either be addressed more rapidly, or eliminated before they become problems.</p>

It is a relatively common spontaneous endocrine disease in \r\n      middle-aged dogs. The mechanism responsible for the disease is multi factorial \r\n      and may include genetic predisposition, obesity, immune-mediated problems \r\n      and chronic pancreatitis. These predisposing factors lead to decreased insulin \r\n      due to destruction of the cells that secrete the hormone. The body is unable \r\n      to effectively utilize and store glucose, proteins, fats and carbohydrates \r\n      needed to maintain homeostasis. Female dogs are affected by canine diabetes \r\n      mellitus twice as much as males. A diagnosis of dog diabetes is based on \r\n      persistent fasting hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels) and glycosuria \r\n      (presence of glucose in the urine). Treatment involves a special diet (high \r\n      fiber, high complex carbohydrate) fed in small amounts several times a day, \r\n      which helps the body to produce, use and stabilize insulin and glucose levels. \r\n      Regular exercise for maintaining healthy body weight and the correct functioning \r\n      of the organic systems is also required. Herbs can help to achieve balance, \r\n      by directly acting on the blood sugar level and indirectly by supporting \r\n      organs and systems. \r\n      <p><strong><font color=\"006666\">Ingredients</font></strong><br>\r\n        Jambul: The volatile oils contain eugenol and metil salicylate; the fresh \r\n        seeds have been found most effective in diabetes, as they quickly reduce \r\n        blood sugar levels; very beneficial in glycosuria, with no harmful effect \r\n        reported.</p>\r\n      <p>Devil\xE2\x80\x99s Club: Helps to balance the glandular system and metabolism.</p>\r\n      <p>Fenugreek: A bitter, diuretic herb that improves digestion, soothes irritated \r\n        tissues, reduces blood sugar levels and has healing properties.</p>\r\n      <p>Gymnema: The gymnemic acid binds to the sugar-receptors, blocking temporarily \r\n        the absorption of sugar molecules.</p>\r\n      <p>Goat\xE2\x80\x99s Rue: A bitter, mucilaginous, tonic herb; stimulates and \r\n        protects the liver and controls blood sugar levels.</p>\r\n      <p>Oregon Grape: Berberine leads to healthier pancreatic tissue, promoting \r\n        regeneration and functional recovery of B-cells. <br>\r\n        Blueberry: Acts as an urinary antiseptic (arbutin action) and reduces \r\n        blood sugar levels (glucoquinones action).</p>\r\n      <p>Dandelion: Diuretic, nutritive, protects the kidneys, stimulates liver \r\n        function, and reduces swelling and inflammation.</p>\r\n      <p>Milk Vetch: A sweet, tonic herb, stimulates the urinary and immune systems, \r\n        lowers blood sugar level.</p>\r\n      <p><font color=\"006666\"><strong>Dosage</strong></font><br>\r\n        To be taken twice daily.

Diseases that have a heritable component \r\n        are significant also for their potential to affect populations. Certain \r\n        defects are surgically correctable. For any origin, the sooner the treatment \r\n        is initiated, the better the chances of animal survival.

    <p><strong>About Worms in Dogs</strong><br />Dogs are subject to infestation by many types of worms (internal parasites), including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Roundworms </li>
        <li>Tapeworms </li>
        <li>Hookworms </li>
        <li>Whipworms </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learn more about <a href="http://www.petwellbeing.com/inulin-PK-dog-worms-p39.cfm">dog worms</a> in the PetWellbeing.com learning center. </p>
    <p>Dog worms attach themselves to the lining of the intestine (the &ldquo;intestinal mucosa&rdquo;) and consume a dog&rsquo;s blood for food. They also prevent your dog from absorbing nutrients, sapping your dog of it health and energy.</p>
    <p>The most common types of internal parasites in dogs are roundworm and hookworm. Puppies are especially likely to get worms, as they can pick them up through their mother&rsquo;s placenta or from her breast milk. </p>
    <p>Dogs can also get worms from eating small rodents which have worms, or from eating contaminated feces. Dogs can pick up hookworm through the skin. An expert can tell whether a dog has worms by examining the dog&rsquo;s feces.</p>
    <p><strong class="red">Customer Testimonial</strong><br />&ldquo;The other day, I noticed that my little dog Oban was looking a little down in the mouth. A day later he started getting diarrhea and even vomited. I also noticed he seemed to have lost weight. I was so worried and rushed to the vet to see what was going on. At the visit it was decided that Oban had roundworm. The vet gave me some treatment and off I went. I was telling my friend this and she told me to treat Oban with Inulin PK, a more natural product for this condition. I did just that and the transformation has been amazing. Oban is looking and feeling better. Great product, great price. Cheers&rdquo; Rhiannon<br />Jackson Hole, WY</p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms of Canine Worms</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your dog loses weight or can&rsquo;t gain weight </li>
        <li>Your dog loses energy, becomes apathetic </li>
        <li>Vomiting and diarrhea </li>
        <li>Swollen abdomen and rough coat (for puppies) </li>
        <li>Dark colored and particularly bad-smelling dog feces </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Preventing and Eliminating Worms in Dogs</strong><br />The first layer of prevention is to keep your yard clear of dog and animal feces, to prevent ingestion by your dog. Inulin PK, taken orally, will protect your dog&rsquo;s intestinal mucosa against worms. It will also help heal and regenerate tissues damaged by dog worms. Finally, it will help strengthen your dog&rsquo;s immune system, so its body can resist and fight worms on its own.</p>

    <p><strong><br />What causes dog&rsquo;s bad breath?</strong><br />Dogs, like people, are subject to plaque build-up on their teeth. Of course, the situation with dogs is even worse as few of them brush their teeth twice a day! When you also consider that rarely are leafy greens the backbone of a dog&rsquo;s diet, it&rsquo;s really not surprising that dogs suffer from bad breath. </p>
    <p>Other dental problems are also common in dogs: periodontal disease, tooth decay, bacterial infections, etc. Is it any wonder dogs sometimes get bad breath?</p>
    <p>All dogs have some degree of breath odor. In itself, a dog&rsquo;s bad breath is no big deal. But what causes a dog&rsquo;s bad breath can definitely be a big deal: Particularly bad breath may be a sign that bacteria and other toxins are destroying your dog&rsquo;s teeth and gums. </p>
    <p>Even worse, the effects of dental diseases are not just confined to your dog&rsquo;s mouth. Its effects are felt throughout your dog&rsquo;s body. Periodontal diseases can actually shorten your dog&rsquo;s life, and should be treated.</p>
    <p>Canine mouth drops are more than simply an herbal mouthwash for your dog. They&rsquo;ll help:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Treat canine gingivitis (plaque build up) </li>
        <li>Fight your dog&rsquo;s tooth decay and other dental problems </li>
        <li>Combat bacterial infections </li>
        <li>Cleanse your dog&rsquo;s mouth </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Supraglan uses natural ingredients to lower your dog&rsquo;s adrenal system from a hyperactive functioning state, slowing overproduction of corticosteroid hormones. Traditional therapies work more like chemotherapy; actually eroding the layers of the adrenal gland that produces corticosteroid hormones. <br /><br /><strong>Natural, herbal treatment: Supraglan is Vet-formulated and approved</strong></p>
    <p>Cushing's syndrome is a myriad of abnormalities that are the result of hypersecretion of corticosteroids by the adrenal cortex. Supraglan was formulated by a leading naturopathic veterinarian to normalize adrenal functioning and to ease symptoms of Cushing&rsquo;s. It is gentle yet effective, safe for long-term use without adverse side effects. </p>
    <p>Supraglan is designed to restore your pet&rsquo;s quality lifestyle and to increase life expectancy by reducing thirst and regulating elimination (liver/kidney and digestive); balancing blood sugar levels (endocrine); increasing muscle use and ability (anti-inflammatory); protecting against infection (immune); and by promoting a healthy skin and coat (natural herbs)</p>
    <p><strong>How do the Ingredients treat Cushings Disease</strong>?<br /><br /><strong>Bistort:</strong> restores and invigorates the liver and kidneys <br /><strong>Wild Yam:</strong> works as an anti-inflammatory<br /><strong>Milk Vetch:</strong> stimulates the liver to clear toxins<br /><strong>Dandelion:</strong> eases the digestive symptoms of Cushing's &amp; stimulates appetite<br /><strong>Licorice: </strong>enhances natural cortisol effects decreasing the need for synthetic corticosteroids <br /><strong>Borage:</strong> restores adrenal cortex, stimulates endocrine system &amp; improves immune system<br /><strong>Eleutherococus Senticosus:</strong> balances hormonal actions (ACTH &amp; cortisone) of adrenal glands</p>
    <p><strong>What is Cushing's disease?</strong></p>
    <p>Cushing's disease results from an excess of adrenal gland hormones. It is a common side-effect of drugs like Prednisone, which is often prescribed to treat dog arthritis, allergies and other ailments. Cushing's disease can also result from a benign tumor on one of the adrenal glands or the pituitary gland.</p>
    <p>Symptoms of Cushing's disease include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased thirst and appetite </li>
        <li>Frequent urination </li>
        <li>Loss of hair </li>
        <li>Skin problems </li>
        <li>Panting </li>
        <li>High blood pressure </li>
        <li>Increased susceptibility to infections </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If left untreated, Cushing's disease can lead to even worse conditions like diabetes and heart problems.</p>
    <p><strong>Traditional Therapies </strong></p>
    <p>Note: If your dog&rsquo;s Cushing&rsquo;s could be caused by a corticosteroid drug such as Prednisone, it may be possible to wean your dog off the drug. You should speak to your vet about this. Prednisone sometimes has side effects that are worse than the condition it was used to treat, and makes your dog more susceptible to bacterial and viral infections. Every day, we get calls from customers looking for an alternative to Prednisone<br />L-deprenyl (Anipryl) - for treatment of pituitary-dependent Cushing&rsquo;s disease (PDH), especially in cases that are mild and when owners are unwilling to risk the adverse effects associated with mitotane or trilostane. The experience of most veterinarians who have used the drug for the treatment of this condition has been poor.</p>
    <p><strong>Mitotane (Lysodren)</strong> - During its evaluation as an insecticide, mitotane was discovered to have adrenocorticolytic effects. The most obvious and rapid response is a reduction in water intake, urine output, and appetite, which usually occur at the end of the initial course of therapy. Muscle strength and exercise tolerance improve over the first 3-4 weeks. Skin and hair coat changes take longer and the progress is variable. After the first re-evaluation, rechecks should be scheduled every 3-6 months for the rest of the pet&rsquo;s life to determine whether the dose of mitotane needs to be adjusted depending on the results of ACTH response testing. Overall, based on the results of three survival studies, the mean survival time of treated dogs with pituitary-dependent Cushing&rsquo;s disease is 24 to 30 months with a range of 1 day to 13 years. </p>
    <p><strong>Surgery </strong>- If your dog's Cushing's disease was caused by a tumor, surgery might be an option. Only your vet can answer this question.</p>
    <p><strong>Trilostane</strong> - Trilostane has been shown to be an effective treatment for canine and feline<br />Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome. Trilostane is a synthetic, orally active steroid analogue. It acts as a competitive inhibitor of the 3&beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenate enzyme system and thereby inhibits the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone as well as other steroids. The blockade is reversible and appears to be dose related.</p>
    <p><strong>Why should you try Supraglan? Our customers have the final word...</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;I just wanted to let you know how very pleased I am with Supraglan. My dog had suffered from Cushing's disease for over two years, but now - just one month after starting Supraglan - his skin, fur and energy level are noticeably better. And I've only gone through half a bottle!&quot; - Valerie P., Los Angeles</p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;When he started peeing in the house for no reason, I took my 10-year old terrier cross (Ben) to the vet. Turns out Ben has Cushing's disease. The vet wanted to put Ben on some harsh and expensive drugs, but I didn't think Ben could handle the side effects. After talking to some friends, we put Ben on Supraglan instead. I can't tell you how great it is to find a safe, natural treatment that really works!</p>
    <p><img src="/UserFiles/Image/ben.jpg" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Last week I took Ben back to the vet. Immediately, the vet could see how Ben had improved. I told the vet about Supraglan, and he said he was going to start recommending it to anyone seeking a natural, alternative treatment for Cushing's&quot; - Kelly J., Chicago</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;I just wanted to say thanks for your wonderful product Supraglan. We started our dog Ralphie on it last September and it gave us months of extra quality time with him. The Cushings finally did get to him to the point where we had to put him to rest on Monday. If it weren't for your product it would have been a long time ago.<br />Again many thanks,&quot; - Jerry Shuren</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<img height="240" width="320" src="/UserFiles/Image/supra-IMG_0329-768726.JPG" alt="dog in swimming pool" /></p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Our TT-Jazz could barely stand on her feet. She was very weak. Blood test showed she had a toxic liver and more tests were needed confirm Cushings Disease and/or cancer. I was devastated over her illness. The high medical costs that did not guarantee her recovery, with her age as an issue, added to my distress. So I prepared for the worse.</p>
    <p>Thanks to web research I discovered your site and purchased Milk Thistle and Supraglan. That was a month ago, and TT-Jazz has renewed energy, a healthy appetite -- actually she's back to her old finicky self again. Her coat is looking more healthy, and she's light on her feet. I've been given additional quality time with her -- and for her age that's important to me. Thanks for your knowledge in the products and kind support.</p>
    <p>The customer rep was always kind and patient with me. She knew I wanted to make my pet's aging life as comfortable as possible. She provided clear explanation about the products. The rep's quality assistance paid off. Much thanks to her.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;I was skeptical if Supraglan would help our 11 year old beagle with Cushings Syndrome. It has! He has much more energy, his sway back has straightened some, limp is gone, eyes are white, and his stomach is not nearly as bloated.&quot; </p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />When I took our 13 year old Border Collie - Katana - to the Vet in early February, I was told there wasn't really anything more they could do. She did not tolerate the Lysoderm and actually quit eating &amp; could barely get up. Her hair was incredibly thin &amp; about 2 inches of the tip of her tail was bald. We started her on Supraglan early February. She is now getting around much better. Her appetite is definitely back and the most amazing thing is that her hair has filled out again and the tip of her tail is totally covered with hair. She is much more comfortable, not perfect by any means but she looks &amp; acts much better. I'm going to let my Vet know about Supraglan as she said she is always looking for alternative medicines. <br />Sincerely, Teresa R.</p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">The misery caused by colds and flu</p>
    <p>Don't you wish there was a sure-fire cure for colds and flu? Aren't you tired of wasting money on expensive drug store medications that simply don't work?</p>
    <p>Well, we can't promise that Cold &amp; Flu Essentials will prevent you from ever catching cold again. But we can promise that it is the most effective preventative and treatment we've ever encountered. </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">The natural, effective treatment for colds and flu</p>
    <p>Our naturopathic doctor - one of the best in the business - painstakingly researched natural remedies and gradually developed Cold &amp; Flu Essentials. It's a unique combination of top quality herbs, proven to be effective in fighting or preventing colds and flu.</p>
    <p>It is safe and non-addictive, loaded with ingredients specially selected to relieve cold and flu symptoms: cough, runny nose, sore throat, aches, fever and fatigue. </p>
    <p>Start taking it at the first sign of a cold or flu: sore throat, blocked nose, fever, etc. It greatly reduces the chances that a cold or flu will &quot;take hold&quot;. </p>
    <p>As it has no adverse side effects, you can even take it as a preventative whenever a cold or flu is &quot;going around&quot;. </p>
    <p>Don't let the drug companies continue to pick your pockets for their ineffective &quot;remedies&quot;. Give Cold &amp; Flu Essentials a try. We're confident you'll be back for more!<br /> </p>
    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. What is the dosage?</p>
    <p>If a cold or flu has already taken hold, the regular dosage is 2 capsules, 3 times a day. This will reduce all cold symptoms and speed recovery.</p>
    <p>When taken as a preventative (i.e. when a cold or flu is &quot;going around&quot;; but hasn't hit you yet) we suggest 1 capsule, three times a day.</p>
    <p>If you're starting to feel symptoms, take 3 capsules, 3 times for one or two days. This will often fight off the cold or flu before it has a chance to take hold.<br /> </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Will it cure my cold or flu?</p>
    <p>Sorry, but there is simply no outright cure for colds and flu. But Cold &amp; Flu Essentials is highly effective at staving off these viral infections, fighting their symptoms should they take hold, and speeding your recovery time.<br /> </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Are there any side effects?</p>
    <p>No. In fact, Cold &amp; Flu Essentials is actually good for you. Its natural herbal ingredients keep your immune system strong, helping your body fight any number of potential ailments.<br /> </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">4. Is it safe for children?</p>
    <p>We don't recommend it for children under 5. For children aged 5 - 12, we recommend a half dosage (1 capsule, 3 times a day). Children over 12 can take the adult dosage. In the unlikely event of an adverse reaction, stop administering the product and consult a doctor.<br /> </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">5. How long does a bottle last?</p>
    <p>At the standard adult dose of 6 capsules per day, a bottle will last 15 days.<br /> </p>

    <p>&quot;I had a major triathlon coming up. Sure enough, about 48 hours before the big day, I felt a nasty cold coming on. I took a double dose of Cold &amp; Flu Essentials, and by the day of the triathlon, I was 100%. I placed 5th in a field of 250! I just can't believe how well it worked.

    <p>&quot;I've always been skeptical of natural remedies, organics and the like. But I got a really nasty flu last month and I was desperate for relief. I ordered two bottles of Cold &amp; Flu essentials by overnight delivery and it turned out to be the best investment I've ever made! Within hours of taking it, I started feeling more comfortable. And in record time, the flu was gone altogether. I'd recommend this product to anyone.&quot;<br />Moira Storm, Boston</p>

          Vitamins and minerals are necessary to ensure all the body's functions are 
          working properly. They are also administered to animals and pets for prevention 
          and treatment of many illnesses. The levels of vitamins and minerals needed 
          in the body can vary according to factors like age and lifestyle. These 
          elements are given to or obtained by pets through food (e.g. dogs can make 
          their own vitamin A from carotenes found in vegetables), but sometimes they 
          are not in the easiest form for the animal to assimilate. Dog vitamins can 
          help give your pet the proper nutrients they may not be obtaining from their 
          current diet. A well balanced diet is the key to avoiding vitamin and mineral 
          deficiencies. Give raw foods to your pets, as fresh, uncooked whole foods 
          have life energy! Including pet vitamins in the form of herbal extracts 
          can provide an excellent source of energy; vitamins and minerals found in 
          plants are readily and efficiently absorbed into your pet's body. These 
          can help avoid anemia, malnutrition and digestive malfunctions.

          Human and animal organisms have developed strategies to cope with and respond 
          to their environment. Adaptive immune responses are important mechanisms 
          that help to maintain the health and well being of the animal. When in different 
          environments or conditions, such mechanisms may be altered to adapt to new 
          conditions, ensuring survival of the organism. Cat separation anxiety, cat 
          stress, and general anxiety can cause animals to rely on these adaptive 
          mechanisms. These organic responses are facilitated by changes in hormone 
          levels, which in turn, help the body adapt to stress. Many of the influences 
          that cause human stress can cause cat stress or anxiety, such as noise, 
          bright lights, crowded places and strange locations. Paying more attention 
          to your pets and doing something as simple as brushing or petting your pets 
          will help them to feel more confident and less stressed. It is also important 
          to remove the source of stress. Herbs are an excellent choice to help alleviate 
          stress symptoms. 
          <p><strong><font color="006666">Ingredients</font></strong><br>
            Chamomile: Contains volatile oils (Alpha-bisabolol), flavonoids (chamazulene) 
            and lactones (matricarin, matricine) with anti-inflammatory action. The 
            polysaccharide components are immunostimulating (activate macrophages 
            and B lymphocytes). It also has analgesic and sedative activities.</p>
          <p>Passion Flower: Contains alkaloids and flavonoids, which are effective, 
            nonaddictive sedatives. It also has anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic 
            activities (apigenin).</p>
          <p>Lemon Balm: An aromatic, sedative herb useful for nervous disorders, 
            excitability and anxiety.</p>
          <p>Reishi Mushroom: A tonic, sedative herb that relieves pain, improves 
            heart and liver function and stimulates the immune system.</p>
          <p>Ginseng: An ancient Chinese herb, used for about 5,000 years. A sweet, 
            tonic herb that both relaxes and stimulates the nervous system, encourages 
            hormone secretion (adrenocorticotropin and costicosterone) and increases 
            resistance to diseases. It is classed as an adaptogen, an herb that increases 
            resistance to stress.</p>
          <p>Coneflower: Contains an important variety of polysaccharides with immunostimulant 
            activities, reduces inflammation and inhibits bacterial formation of hyaluronidase.</p>

    <p><strong><br />What is Dog Arthritis?</strong><br />Dog arthritis is an often painful inflammation of the joints. It can affect your dog at any age, but more often is seen in older dogs.<br /><br /><strong>There are two major types of dog arthritis:</strong> <br />Canine osteoarthritis is very common in older, larger dogs. The cartilage &ndash; which usually cushions the joints between bones &ndash; breaks down. Your dog&rsquo;s joints then start to rub against each other, which is painful and uncomfortable. Canine rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your dog&rsquo;s body starts to reject its own connective tissue and the joints become swollen and painful.<br /><br />The precise causes of dog arthritis are now known. But making sure your dog gets regular exercise and does not become overweight can go a long way to preventing the onset of canine arthritis. With regular exercise, your dog&rsquo;s joints will remain better lubricated. And keeping his weight down will reduce wear on his joints. This is particularly important with larger dog breeds, as their extra weight adds to joint stress.<br /><br /><strong>Symptoms of Canine Arthritis</strong></p>

    <p><strong><br />What is cat adrenal glands dysfunction?</strong><br />There are two types of adrenal gland dysfunctions. Cushing's disease and Addison's disease.</p>
    <p>Cushing's disease is commonly caused by a benign tumor on the pituitary gland. The result is an over production of adrenal gland hormones. Steroid-induced Cushing&rsquo;s is also very prevalent today. Long term use of corticosteroids can cause this condition. Usually it is from the use of prednisone injections for arthritis. Hip tenderness and immobility can start to come to light in latter years, so the cats can be treated for the better part of their adult/senior life. Symptoms of Cushing&rsquo;s disease can sometimes stop or reduce if the steroids are stopped, but a lot of the time the damage is permanent.</p>
    <p>Addison&rsquo;s disease is similar to Cushing&rsquo;s in that in most cases it is brought on by the long term use of corticosteroids. Addison&rsquo;s is when the pet&rsquo;s body makes antibodies that destroy its own adrenal glands. It is very hard to diagnose and is rare, especially in cats. Weakness and vomiting can be signs, but the only way to truly tell it is Addison&rsquo;s is to test for adrenal hormone levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms of feline Cushing's and Addison's disease:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased water intake </li>
        <li>Increased appetite </li>
        <li>Weight gain </li>
        <li>Skin and bladder infections </li>

    <p>Chronic insomnia can cause sleep deprivation and fatigue. Living without the proper amount of sleep can complicate relationships, hinder work performance and lead to serious health issues. Insomnia can include not being able to fall asleep, sporadically waking up in the middle of the night, and not being able to fall back asleep if woken up.</p>
    <h5>The five stages of sleep</h5>
    <p>There are two main stages of sleep, REM (rapid-eye-movement) and Non-REM (non-rapid-eye-movement). REM sleep is the stage associated with dreaming. There are a total of five stages of sleep:</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 1 &mdash; Light Sleep:</strong> The drifting in and out, where a person can be awakened easily. The eyes move slowly and muscle activity slows down.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 2 &mdash; Light Sleep II:</strong> Brain waves are slower and eye movement stops. Short or occasional bursts of rapid waves called sleep spindles occur.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 3 &mdash; Deep Sleep:</strong> The brain begins to produce slow brain waves called delta waves. These slower brain waves are mixed with smaller, faster waves.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 4 &mdash; Deep Sleep II:</strong> A time where there are no eye movements and there is no muscle activity. The brain produces mostly delta waves in this stage.</p>
    <p><strong>Stage 5 &mdash; REM Sleep:</strong> When breathing becomes shallow, irregular and rapid. Eye movements are rapid and jerk or twitch and muscles are temporarily paralyzed.</p>
    <p>The REM stage is where dreams happen but they can occur in the other stages as well. After falling asleep, it takes about 90 minutes for the body to fall into REM sleep and two hours to go through all five stages. The stages are repeated over and over each night.</p>
    <h5>Age appropriate sleeping habits</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Infants spend 50% their time in REM sleep.</li>
        <li>Adults spend only 20% in the REM stage. 50% of their time is spent in light sleep stage II also called delta sleep and 30% in the other stages.</li>
        <li>Seniors spend less time in the light sleep stage, delta sleep, and some might not experience any light sleep patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Causes of insomnia.</h5>
    <p>There are many variables that can cause insomnia and every person&rsquo;s individual circumstances can be different.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>50% of insomnia cases are attributed to depression, grief, stress and anxiety.</li>
        <li>Physical health issues like; arthritis, asthma, breathing problems, indigestion and muscle aches also contribute to insomnia.</li>
        <li>Many over-the-counter and prescription medications can lead to sleep disturbances.</li>
        <li>A lack of calcium and magnesium can cause a person to wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to fall back to sleep.</li>
        <li>Stimulants like smoking, caffeine and some foods can interrupt sleep patterns.</li>
        <li>Systemic disorders that involve body organs like; the brain, heart, kidneys and other internal systems can affect sleep.</li>
        <li>Poor nutritional habits and a sedentary lifestyle are also contributing factors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Physical types of triggers that can contribute to insomnia:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Restless Leg Syndrom (RLS), is a condition where people&rsquo;s legs twitch, jerk or kick involuntarily.  RLS can also cause legs muscle cramps at night.</li>
        <li>Sleep Apnea is considered a potential sleep disorder and is commonly associated with snoring and irregular breathing during the night.  Breathing can stop completely for as long as two minutes while an individual is sleeping.  A person with sleep apnea can awake gasping for air as many as two hundred times a night.</li>
        <li>Central Sleep Apnea is when a person&rsquo;s breathing stops because their diaphragm and chest muscles stop working.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Common symptoms of insomnia</h5>
    <p>Most people who don&rsquo;t get enough sleep experience common symptoms like; irritability and daytime sleepiness.  There is a decrease in their comprehension skills.  They can have a difficult time paying attention to details and are unable to perform repetitive tasks.  Serious overall performance issues can include a lower productivity rate and lack of concentration.  Mild personality changes can cause interpersonal and relationship issues.  Sleep deprivation can also contribute to other physical health issues like chronic fatigue.</p>
    <h5>Sleep deprivation and its dangers</h5>
    <p>Insomnia and severe sleep deprivation can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Impede driving skills</li>
        <li>Cause chronic fatigue</li>
        <li>Diminish social skills</li>
        <li>Trigger mild personality changes</li>
        <li>Interrupt a person&rsquo;s ability to stay on task</li>
        <li>Compound tension, nervousness and anxiety</li>
        <li>Inhibit the ability to stay awake during the day</li>
        <li>Reduce work performance and productivity rate</li>
        <li>Inhibit concentration and decision making skills</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>The Natural Approach to treating insomnia</h5>
    <p>Learning to balance daily stress, tension and anxiety can be the first step in dealing with a sleep disorder.  The holistic approach is to evaluate the triggers that contribute to insomnia.  Herbal supplements are beneficial to bringing the mind, body and spirit back into balance so the body can rest.</p>

    <h5>Frequently-Asked Questions</h5>
    <dl>  	<dt>1. What's it like to suffer from sleep deprivation?</dt> 	<dd>
    <p>Chronic insomnia can cause irritability, daytime exhaustion and can eventually result in mild personality changes and relationship problems.  Not getting a full nights rest lowers a person&rsquo;s productivity rate making it difficult to complete simple tasks.  It can also lead to more serious health issues.  These problems can frustrate a person and cause them to be over reactive and emotional.</p>
    </dd> 	<dt>2. Is insomnia self inflicted by being a &ldquo;worry-wort&rdquo;?</dt> 	<dd>
    <p>Studies have found that 50% of insomnia cases are due to depression and psychological disorders like grief, stress and anxiety.  Insomnia can also be caused by a wide variety of physical issues including, pain, arthritis, asthma, and indigestion.  Other contributing factors are diet and lack of exercise.  Many prescription medications can also cause insomnia.  People who suffer from sleep deprivation are not just hung up on worrying about everything.  The body&rsquo;s chemistry can change as a result of stress, physical challenges and medications.  Individuals who cannot sleep at night are usually at a loss and sometimes feel a desperate need for sleep.</p>
    </dd> 	<dt>3. How common are sleep disorders?</dt> 	<dd>
    <p>Insomnia is very common and affects about one in ten Americans, which is about 40 million people including about 30% of healthy seniors.  Restless leg syndrome is also common and millions of people are affected by RLS.  Sleep Apnea also affects about 20 million Americans and is considered a more serious sleep disorder.

          Separation anxiety probably results from the social nature of domesticated 
          cats and strong affinity (hyper attachment) to their human caretakers. Some 
          pet owners may notice aggression in their cat or kitten. Decreasing cat's 
          dependency on the owner, increasing level of security when isolated and 
          prevention of destructive or dangerous behavior are subjects of the treatment. 
          The herbal therapy objective is to relieve anxiety and calm the animal.

    <p><strong>What is Cat Arthritis?</strong></p>
    <p>Cat Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints and can affect cats of any age, healthy or ill. Cats can be affected by either of two types of feline arthritis. Osteoarthritis usually affects older cats when the cartilage that normally cushions the joint becomes soft and breaks down with age and the joints begin to rub against each other, causing pain and discomfort. Rheumatoid arthritis is when the body rejects its own connective tissue cells, resulting in painful swelling in the joints.</p>
    <p>The cause of feline arthritis is unknown but keeping your cat at a healthy weight and ensuring regular exercise is recommended as a preventative measure. This will keep the joints well lubricated and reduce any strain from excess body weight.</p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms of Cat Arthritis</strong></p>

        <li>Favoring one side of the body </li>

    <p>Acid Reflux Essentials is an all natural remedy that can help people with their daily battle against heartburn, indigestion and stomach discomfort. This herbal blend will effectively control stomach acids and improve the digestive process. It will also work to alleviate the discomfort associated with chest pains, bloating, heartburn and indigestion.</p>
    <p>Acid reflux can be very uncomfortable.  Individuals are often afraid to eat.  They are embarrassed by their symptoms.  Their bodies are usually bloated and painful.  Sleeping can be difficult and many cannot find relief.  Learning how to control the onset of acid reflux symptoms can be the first step to overcoming this awkward health issue.</p>
    <h5>How the stomach works</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Food and beverages travel a specific path in order to reach the stomach to be digested.</li>
        <li>When foods or liquids are eaten, they pass through your throat, then behind the voice box and then through the esophagus.</li>
        <li>Once food and liquid reach the stomach, a digestive enzyme is released. This enzyme is a combination of acid and pepsin.</li>
        <li>
        <p>The esophagus, which is in charge of keeping food where it belongs, closes off its top and bottom sphincters.</p>
        <p>The top sphincter is where the upper throat is, just behind the larynx and the second sphincter it closes is at the bottom where the stomach is. Normally, the esophagus sphincters open when food is ingested so that food can to travel to the stomach. The sphincters close when as the food is digested so the acids and pepsins stay in the stomach as they break down food. In some people, the muscle tone of the sphincters are weak and don&rsquo;t fully close during the digestive process.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>It&rsquo;s when the sphincters remain open, or partially open, that the contents in the stomach, &ldquo;reflux&rdquo; back up the esophagus and into the throat, causing what many know as acid reflux.</em></p>
    <h5>Common acid reflux symptoms</h5>
    <p>Every person can experience different types of symptoms.  Some may only have one or two symptoms that are mild and infrequent.  Others can be prone to severe cases of acid reflux.  Some people might struggle with pain and discomfort every time they eat or drink.  Common symptoms can include;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heartburn</strong> &mdash; also called indigestion and is known to cause a burning sensation or discomfort that moves from the stomach to the middle of the abdomen and chest.  It can also move up and into the throat.</li>
        <li><strong>Regurgitation</strong> &mdash; is the feeling of acid backing up into the throat or mouth and can produce a sour or bitter taste.  Sometimes stomach contents can move upward causing a small amount of vomit that forms into a &ldquo;wet burp&rdquo;.</li>
        <li><strong>Dyspepsia</strong> &mdash; is a more generalized term for overall stomach discomfort.  It can include; stomach bloating, upper abdominal pain or discomfort and sometimes nausea after eating.</li>
        <li><strong>Inhalation</strong> &mdash; In some cases the stomach&rsquo;s contents can reflux and be aspirated into the trachea, bronchi, and lungs causing more discomfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Hiatal hernia</strong> &mdash; There may also be a condition called a hiatal hernia.  This occurs when part of the stomach slides up above the diaphragm into the chest.  When a person has a hiatal hernia, acid reflux symptoms are present and there&rsquo;s also pain around the lower part of the sternum.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Causes of acid reflux</h5>
    <p>Factors that can cause acid reflux include;</p>
    <dl> 	<dt>Diet</dt> 	<dd>The habit of overeating can force the stomach to stay distended.  If the stomach is too full, the esophagus won&rsquo;t be able to close its lower sphincter properly.  This will allow the stomach contents to move back upward, causing acid reflux.  For people who may be overweight or obese, this is a common cause of acid reflux.</dd> 	<dt>Eating Habits</dt> 	<dd>Eating too fast, or while lying down or too close to bedtime are all triggers that can increase symptoms.</dd> 	<dt>Medications</dt> 	<dd>Some over the counter prescriptions can increase the chances of acid reflux because they can alter normal stomach acids and enzymes.</dd> 	<dt>Physical stressors</dt> 	<dd>
    <ul>
        <li>Exercise can increase pressure on the abdomen which can increase the symptoms of acid reflux.  Studies have found that weightlifters had the most acid reflux and runners had milder symptoms with less cases then weightlifters.</li>
        <li>Smoking has been shown to potentially cause acid reflux symptoms too.</li>
        <li>Hiatal hernias can cause acid reflux.  If a person&rsquo;s stomach and lower esophagus slide up above the diaphragm, it can cause acid reflux and increase symptoms like heartburn and pain in the chest.  Movement of the stomach and the esophagus&rsquo; lower sphincter are a sign that a hiatal hernia could be present.  In some cases, acid reflux is the only indication that a person has a hiatal hernia.</li>
    </ul>
    </dd> </dl>
    <h5>Western Medicine and its approach to acid reflux</h5>
    <p>People with constant and severe acid reflux symptoms are often diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  In many cases acid inhibitors are prescribed.  These inhibitors shut off the pumps in the stomach that produce the acids necessary for digestion.  Although an individual&rsquo;s acid reflux symptoms may be less severe or infrequent, the risk of other digestive tract disorders could increase due to a lack of proper digestive enzymes.</p>
    <h5>Acid reflux and its dangers</h5>
    <p>Persistent and intense acid reflux can be an indication that there is a more serious condition present.  Constant acid reflux can cause inflammation to the esophagus that can lead the lining to bleed.

    <p>Hair Essentials Promotes Healthy Hair and New Growth with 15 herbs in its Proprietary blend and 7 essential supplements. </p>
    <p><strong>Proprietary Hair Essentials Blend</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Serenoa Repens (Saw Palmetto)</strong> studies have shown that Saw Palmetto is an effective anti-androgen that can inhibit or block the cell membranes from absorbing high levels of DHT.  By lowering the levels of DHT in the body, Saw Palmetto encourages the body&rsquo;s hormones to stay in balance and can promote a healthy environment for hair to grow.</p>
    <p><strong>Fo Ti Root Powder (Polygoni Multiflori) ( He Shou Wu)</strong> nourishes the liver, kidneys and blood which can promote hair growth. </p>
    <p><strong>MSM </strong>is vital to hair and skin.  It&rsquo;s absorbed very well and the body uses the sulphur in MSM for the structural development of hair.  .</p>
    <p><strong>Collagen Type II (Hyalrunic Acid and Chondroitin complex)</strong> adds strength and structure to connective tissues especially cartilage.  Collagen also helps to restore strength and flexibility to skin, nails and hair.</p>
    <p><strong>Bu Gu Zhi fruit powder</strong> increases circulation and the flow of nutrients to the scalp.  Studies have shown that Bu Gu Zhi helps to encourage hair RE-growth.</p>
    <p><strong>Eclipta Prostrata herb powder (Han Lian Cao)</strong> works for overall hair health and defense against premature gray.</p>
    <p><strong>L-Cysteine HCI </strong>an amino acid works to form the antioxidant glutathione that helps the liver detoxify the body.  It aides the body in the formation of protein, helps to boost energy and metabolism and the synthesis of fatty acids.  Cysteine activates the production of T-cells in the immune system and has been reported to help increase the hair shaft diameter and density of hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>L-Methionine </strong>is an amino acid that converts first to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and then to homocysteine.  Homocysteine turns into either methionine or cysteine.  Both have been reported to; chelate toxins from the body, improve flexibility and tone of skin, strengthen nails and encourage new hair growth.  It&rsquo;s also been found to improve the thickness of fine hair.</p>
    <p><strong>Horsetail Extract </strong>(7% silica) contains large amounts of silica which is necessary to maintain healthy nails, skin and hair.  Silica helps the body absorb calcium, promotes strong bones and encourages healthy nails, skin, teeth and hair.</p>
    <p><strong>Borage Oil </strong>(naturally occurring Essential Fatty acids) contains a high percentage of GLAs (gamma-linolenic acid).  Borage Oil is moisturizing and has anti-inflammatory properties.  It reduces inflamed hair follicles, combats a dry itchy scalp with moisture, and encourages new hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>White Tea Extract </strong>(80% polyphenols) contains high levels of phytochemicals called polyphenols.  Pholyphenols boost the immune function of skin cells and protects them against oxidative stress allowing hair to grow freely. <br /> Oat (bran) contains B complex, minerals, proteins, fats and heart healthy soluble fibers called beta-glucans.  Bran is rich in dietary fiber, helps the body to maintain regularity and eliminate toxic waste from the digestive tract.  The good bacteria in the intestines digests Oat Bran into Small Chain Fatty Acids.  SCFA&rsquo;s act as a PRE-biotic and increase the colon&rsquo;s acidity which inhibits the growth of unhealthy yeasts and bacteria.  Oat Bran acts as an antimicrobial cleansing agent for the body. </p>
    <p><strong>Milk Thistle (seed)</strong> has a main ingredient called Silymarin which is a plant based super-anitioxidant.  This powerful antioxidant is often used to increase the detoxification process of the liver.  Milk Thistle seed is thought to be much stronger than Vitamin E or C in fighting free radical damage.  Studies have shown that it enhances protein synthesis and supports healthy blood flow.</p>
    <p><strong>Flaxseed Oil</strong> (naturally occurring Essential Fatty acids) increases circulation to the scalp.  A deficiency in Essential Fatty acids can result in dry lifeless hair.  Flaxseed oil has been known to encourage healthy shiny new hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>Bioperine</strong> (black pepper extract) enhances the rate of how nutrients and herbal extracts are absorbed.  Formulas that contain Bioperine offer the full benefit of the formulated supplement because Bioperine increases a blended supplements activity.</p>
    <p><strong>Vitamin A</strong> (as beta carotene) helps to form and maintain healthy skin, hair and mucous membranes.  It protects cells and acts as an antioxidant.  It also neutralizes free radicals, prevents cell damage and helps to reduce bacterial growth in both glandular ducts and the skin&rsquo;s surface allowing hair to grow naturally.</p>
    <p><strong>Vitamin C</strong> (as calcium ascorbate) is an excellent free radical scavenger.  Calcium ascorbate is a natural form of Vitamin C and easily absorbed into the bloodstream for maximum benefit.  It can reverse oxidative stress and also functions to increase the synthesis of collagen. </p>
    <p><strong>Vitamin E</strong> (as d-alpha tocopherol succinate) is an antioxidant that protects the immune system from oxidative stress.  In the form of d-alpha tocopherol succinate it is thought to be more stable than most other forms of Vitamin E.  It interacts with other antioxidants by improving their nutritional absorption and enhances the use of Vitamin A</p>
    <p><strong>Biotin is a B vitamin</strong>.  A deficiency of Biotin in the body can cause alopecia (hair loss).  Biotin promotes healthy nails and hair.  Too much or too little oil on the scalp can inhibit hair growth.  Biotin is well known to be able to improve the metabolism of scalp oils making the scalp a safe place for hair to grow.</p>
    <p><strong>Iodine</strong> (from kelp) contains B-complex vitamins and is an excellent source of natural iodine, magnesium, zinc and calcium and is very high in vitamin K.  Sea Kelp is very nutritional and helps hair grow.  Hair grows faster and longer if it doesn&rsquo;t lie dormant for too long.  The iodine in kelp regulates the production of the thyroid gland&rsquo;s hormone thyroxin.  It helps to regulate how long hair stays in the dormant stage and encourages the hair to be active so it can grow. </p>
    <p><strong>Zinc</strong> (as amion acid chelate) is essential for cell growth and easily absorbed by the body.  Symptoms of a zinc deficiency can include dandruff and hair loss.  Zinc acts as an antioxidant.  It helps boost the immune system and fight infections.  It has been found to have an affect on the levels of androgens (a hormone known to be involved with some forms of genetic hair loss). </p>
    <p><strong>Selenium</strong> (as amino acid chelate) is a super antioxidant that the body can use to improve most inflammatory conditions.  When combined with Vitamin E, selenium provides a significant benefit and helps the thyroid gland function properly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Made  with the highest quality ingredients, derived from the oldest, safest,  and most effective medicinal system in history. </li>
        <li>Cellulose capsules are filled with fine ground herbal powders that are easy to swallow and contain no animal products. </li>

    <p><strong>How does Hair Essentials promote new hair growth?</strong> </p>
    <p>First, it fights DHT to prevent further hair loss. It does this using a powerful combination of herbs, clinically proven to decrease DHT levels in the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>Next, Hair Essentials seeds your follicles with everything they need for new hair growth. Taken orally, Hair Essentials' powerful nutrients are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and go straight to your scalp. There, they repair damaged hair follicles and kick-start inactive ones. The result? Healthy new hair growth!</p>
    <p><strong>How soon will I see new hair growth?</strong></p>
    Some customers report new hair growth within a month. But since hair growth takes time, we recommend that you use Hair Essentials for at least 90 days to see best results.
    <p>You'll also notice that your hair grows faster: many customers report 75% to 100% faster hair growth after three months.</p>
    <p><strong>Will I need to use Hair Essentials forever to avoid future hair loss?</strong></p>
    <p>Not necessarily. Once Hair Essentials has repaired your follicles, hair growth often continues even after you've stopped using it. In other cases, continued use (perhaps at a lesser dosage) may be needed to maintain new hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>Other hair growth products appear to be similar. How is Hair Essentials different?</strong></p>
    <p>It's a classic example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts: what really makes Hair Essentials work is its unique, synergistic combination of ingredients. Some combat DHT, stopping further hair loss. Other ingredients repair your follicles and aggressively seed them with all the nutrients they need to grow healthy new hair.</p>
    <p>ONLY Hair Essentials contains our painstakingly researched, Doctor-formulated combination of powerful herbs, each reinforcing the effects of the others. Quite simply, there&rsquo;s no other hair growth product that comes close to Hair Essentials.</p>
    <strong>Is hair loss reversible?</strong>
    <p>Yes! Products that reduce the effects of DHT can stop hair loss. And with proper nourishment, damaged and dormant hair follicles can be repaired and reactivated, resulting in new hair growth.</p>

Take to care feed your dog a balanced diet. Avoid a \r\n        diet excessively high in protein with too many calories, vitamins and \r\n        minerals.

Insulin, \r\n      secreted by the pancreas, regulates sugar blood level. When insulin production \r\n      cannot be controlled, diabetes ensues. This can be due to obesity, genetics, \r\n      stress, fluctuating hormones, medication, and lack of a nutritional diet. \r\n      Insulin helps to regulate the blood sugar level by acting as a doorway between \r\n      glucose and the cells that use glucose for energy. Without insulin, the \r\n      cells have no energy source. The cells become hungry, and the animal will \r\n      start to eat more in order to supply more energy to its body. The body goes \r\n      into starvation mode and starts to use stored fat and protein cells as energy, \r\n      hence the reason why pets tend to lose weight even though they consume more \r\n      food. The excess glucose in the blood is flushed out by the kidneys through \r\n      urination. Because of all the extra water being used to do this, the pet \r\n      is often thirsty, and will urinate much more frequently. Diabetes tends \r\n      to be more common in male cats than female cats. Higher risk segments tend \r\n      to be neutered males and unsprayed females, and cats over 6 years of age. \r\n      Breed is not a factor. \r\n      <p><strong><font color=\"006666\">Ingredients</font></strong><br>\r\n        Jambul: The volatile oils contain eugenol and metil salicylate; the fresh \r\n        seeds have been found most effective in diabetes, as they quickly reduce \r\n        blood sugar levels; very beneficial in glycosuria, with no harmful effect \r\n        reported.</p>\r\n      <p>Devil\xE2\x80\x99s Club: Helps to balance the glandular system and metabolism.</p>\r\n      <p>Fenugreek: A bitter, diuretic herb that improves digestion, soothes irritated \r\n        tissues, reduces blood sugar levels and has healing properties.</p>\r\n      <p>Gymnema: The gymnemic acid binds to the sugar-receptors, blocking temporarily \r\n        the absorption of sugar molecules.</p>\r\n      <p>Goat\xE2\x80\x99s Rue: A bitter, mucilaginous, tonic herb; stimulates and \r\n        protects the liver and controls blood sugar levels.</p>\r\n      <p>Oregon Grape: Berberine leads to healthier pancreatic tissue, promoting \r\n        regeneration and functional recovery of B-cells. <br>\r\n        Blueberry: Acts as an urinary antiseptic (arbutin action) and reduces \r\n        blood sugar levels (glucoquinones action).</p>\r\n      <p>Dandelion: Diuretic, nutritive, protects the kidneys, stimulates liver \r\n        function, and reduces swelling and inflammation.</p>\r\n      <p>Milk Vetch: A sweet, tonic herb, stimulates the urinary and immune systems, \r\n        lowers blood sugar level.</p>\r\n      <p><font color=\"006666\"><strong>Dosage</strong></font><br>\r\n        To be taken twice daily.

    <p><strong>About Cat Fleas </strong></p>
    <p><span>Cat fleas love a warm place to live and your cat is the perfect host. They feed on your cat's blood, weakening them. Cat fleas are disease-carrying organisms that can also trigger allergic reactions in your pet. They often affect weak animals and/or those in poor health. Fleas can transfer themselves from your pet to you or to another animal and can live for up to 30 days, the typical flea&rsquo;s life cycle. Keeping your cat&rsquo;s living space clean is an important part of prevention and reduction of cat flea infestation. Make sure to regularly vacuum and wash toys or blankets and cushions. Fleas harbor tapeworm eggs so getting rid of these pests will help to keep your cat safe and healthy. Target Spray is safe and easy to use as a preventative and treatment of cat fleas.</span></p>

    <p>The liver is the second largest  organ in the body and its primary responsibility is to eliminate toxins from  the body.&nbsp; A healthy liver also helps to  maintain and regulate bodily fluids that work to keep the body alive.&nbsp; </p>
    <strong>Liver functions:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>	Detoxification: The liver removes excess hormones, heavy metals, chemicals and other waste products.</li>
        <li>	Filtration: The liver filters out unwanted substances and recycles an estimated 2 quarts of blood every minute.</li>
        <li>	Storage: The liver stores blood and releases it to the body when it needs it.  It also stores iron and other vital nutrients like vitamins.</li>
        <li>	Defense: The liver is one of the main defenses for the immune system.</li>
        <li>	Production: The liver produces bile in order to digest fat.  Bile also carries toxins out of the body.</li>
        <li>	Creation &amp; Maintenance: The liver creates fat, protein, cholesterol and enzymes.  It also metabolizes fat, protein and carbohydrates in the body.<br />   </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Signs of a sluggish liver:</strong>
    <p>Medical doctors will take a group of blood tests to identify liver damage. In cases of infectious liver disease or alcohol-related damage the conventional blood tests will not show how the liver is functioning, or show its capability in the absence of severe liver damage.  In order to evaluate how the liver is performing, naturopathic physicians often look for signs of a sluggish liver.  The liver will function in a sluggish capacity due to poor nutrition and digestion.  It will also function slower if it&rsquo;s not excreting bile properly or has had excessive exposure to toxins.  Signs of a sluggish liver can include: </p>
    <p><strong>Physical Signs:</strong><br /> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nervous system disorders</li>
        <li>Allergies</li>

        <li> Swelling and/or lumps in the neck, groin, thighs and sides of the body</li>
        <li> Inflexible and rigid body</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The liver and how it functions can be stressed by:</strong><br /> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Excess hormone production</li>
        <li>Alcohol and drug use</li>
        <li>Irregular and improper diet and nutrition</li>
        <li> Exposure to toxins and toxic build-up<br />   </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Common health issues related to an unhealthy liver include:</strong><br /> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>PMS</li>
        <li>Cataracts and glaucoma</li>
        <li>Blood disorders</li>
        <li>Anemia</li>
        <li>Acne, eczema and boils</li>
        <li>Allergies</li>
        <li>Arthritis</li>
        <li>Degenerative diseases, including some forms of cancer</li>
        <li> Heart disease</li>
        <li>Vascular disease</li>
        <li>High blood pressure and cholesterol</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Liver stores and purifies the  blood as it works to detoxify the body.&nbsp;  This multifunctional gland is responsible for putting more blood into  circulation during periods of greater activity.&nbsp;  If the liver is sluggish, the blood purification process can be  inadequate and can lead to the release of toxins in the body.&nbsp; Toxic blood that&rsquo;s recycled through the body  can seep out of the skin causing skin disorders.&nbsp; Impure blood also feeds most degenerative  diseases including arthritis, cancer, heart disease and many others.&nbsp; When the liver is not functioning properly it  is called Liver Blood Deficiency Syndrome.</p>
    <p>The long term effects of a  stagnant or sluggish liver can complicate a person&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; It can also lead to new health emergencies  like heart disease, cancer, vascular disease and many other degenerative  diseases.&nbsp; Keeping the liver healthy is a  high priority.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><strong>The Kidney Connection</strong><br /> In order to keep the liver healthy, the kidneys should be supported.  The kidneys are considered the &ldquo;mother of the liver&rdquo;.  The kidneys cool and decongest the liver.</p>
    <p><strong>The Spleen &amp; Pancreas Connection</strong><br />   The liver is also connected to the spleen and how the pancreas functions.  An imbalance in the liver can cause ulcers, diabetes, indigestion and abdominal discomfort.  The spleen and pancreas directly influence the intestines and inflammatory conditions like colitis and enteritis.<br />   The Heart Connection<br />   Heart and vascular disease are also closely tied to how the liver functions.  The liver&rsquo;s blood flows naturally to the heart.  A liver that is not able to produce, store or circulate healthy blood cannot send healthy blood to the heart.</p>
    <p><strong>The Gallbladder Connection</strong><br />   When the liver is not functioning properly, sediment can settle out of the bile in the gall bladder.  This sediment can be in the form of stones, sand or mud.  The gallbladder acts as a holding tank for bile, if it gets clogged with sediment, it can result in pain below the rib cage, tension in the neck and shoulders, chest pain and a bitter taste in the mouth.<br /> </p>
    <p><strong>How to Have a Healthy Liver</strong><br />   Digging down to the root of a liver imbalance is easy once the fundamental connection of how important the liver is to the body.  A diet low in saturated fat, high in fiber and raw foods is one way to encourage a healthy liver.  Introducing nutritional supplements that can help support and soothe the liver is another important tool to having a healthy liver.</p>
    <p><strong>Healthy Liver Essentials&mdash;The Natural Liver Support Tool</strong><br />   Healthy Liver Essentials is a supportive blend of eleven herbs that tonifies and strengthens the liver and its sister organs.

                <p><font color="#006666"><strong>Description<br />         </strong></font>Dog diarrhea is a common condition that arises from many          different causes, most commonly infectious ones. Agents that cause this          include bacterial toxins, viruses, cathartic agents, and some medications.          It is a principal defense against agents that affect the intestinal tract.          Agents trigger an increase in intestinal movements (peristalsis), forcing          contents rapidly through the digestive tract, allowing no time for the          colon to absorb enough water, thus the feces become abnormally fluid.          In healthy organisms, mild, short diarrhea is not harmful, but electrolyte          loss and fluid loss are dangerous if dogs are debilitated, or are very          young or very old. As canine diarrhea is a common symptom, the owner must          try to find the cause of it. Fluid and electrolyte consumption should          be kept up for quicker recovery. Puppy owners should be especially careful          as diarrhea caused by parasites may result in death. Herbs that help regulate          intestinal function will be valuable in the process.        </p>

          Vitamins and minerals are necessary to ensure all the body's functions are 
          working properly. They are also administered to animals and pets for prevention 
          and treatment of many illnesses. The levels of vitamins and minerals needed 
          in the body can vary according to factors like age and lifestyle. These 
          elements are given to or obtained by pets through food , but sometimes they 
          are not in the easiest form for the animal to assimilate. Cat vitamins can 
          help give your pet the proper nutrients they may not be obtaining from their 
          current diet. A well balanced diet is the key to avoiding vitamin and mineral 
          deficiencies. Give raw foods to your pets, as fresh, uncooked whole foods 
          have life energy! Including pet vitamins in the form of herbal extracts 
          can provide an excellent source of energy; vitamins and minerals found in 
          plants are readily and efficiently absorbed into your pet's body. These 
          can help avoid anemia, malnutrition and digestive malfunctions.

    <p><strong><br />About dog fleas</strong><br />We&rsquo;re all familiar with fleas. They are, by far, the most common parasite found on dogs. These small, dark brown insects make their homes in the warmth of your dog&rsquo;s fur and feed on your dog&rsquo;s blood. Flea bites can bring almost unbearable discomfort to your dog, making your pet scratch until his fur falls out and his skin is raw. </p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms of dog flea infestation</strong><br />Unlike ear mites, fleas are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. Pull back your dog&rsquo;s fur, and you may see them scurrying for shelter. Fleas are easier to see on light-colored dogs. But even if you can&rsquo;t see fleas on your dog, there are telltale signs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your dog will scratch incessantly </li>
        <li>Red and inflamed areas may appear on your dog&rsquo;s skin </li>
        <li>Fine, black debris may be seen on your dog&rsquo;s skin and stuck in his fur. This is actually a mixture of dried blood and other flea debris. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dog fleas can easily jump onto another pet &ndash; or onto you. Fleas can spread disease and trigger an allergic reaction, particularly among older, weaker dogs. They can harbor the eggs of tapeworms, spreading them. Dog fleas are more than just a nuisance: they&rsquo;re a real health risk to your dog.</p>
    <p><strong>Avoiding or controlling dog fleas</strong><br />The first step in keeping fleas off your dog is to keep your dog&rsquo;s living area clean. Fleas hide in carpets, so be sure to vacuum regularly. Dog bedding and blankets should be washed regularly.</p>
    <p>Regular application of Canine Target Spray is extremely helpful in controlling fleas. It is effective both at eliminating fleas already present, and as a preventative measure (discouraging new fleas from nesting on your dog).</p>

    <p><strong>What is Anxiety and Aggression in Dogs?</strong><br />Dog aggression can occur for a variety of reasons and can be frustrating and stressful for the owner. </p>
    <p>Does your dog react negatively towards some people and not others? Some dogs will single out men, children or those with a certain characteristic such as men with beards, or people wearing hats. This can be the result of negative experiences when your dog was a puppy. Men and children also tend to evoke more aggressive behavior in dogs because they themselves display more aggressive behavior. </p>
    <p><strong>Common Symptoms of Dog Anxiety and Aggression in Dogs</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Altered behavior only when you, the owner, are not present </li>
        <li>Distress vocalization (barking, howling) </li>
        <li>Destructiveness (chewing furniture, digging, scratching) and self-trauma </li>
        <li>Inappropriate elimination (urinary or fecal) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some dog breeds are naturally more aggressive than others and some dogs may display aggressive behavior as the result of fear because they have had little exposure to other dogs or people. </p>
    <p>Sometimes dogs are simply aggressive because they are in discomfort or pain, so it is always best to first have your dog checked by your veterinarian, especially if canine aggression is an unusual characteristic for your four-legged friend. </p>
    <p><strong>Behavioral treatments for dog aggression or anxiety</strong><br />If you can identify what frightens your dog, you can help him overcome his fear by gradually introducing that person/item from a distance when your dog is in a relaxed mood. As he becomes more comfortable and remains calm, increase the frequency and proximity of the person/item that frightens him. </p>
    <p>For example, if your dog is afraid of men, have a male friend stand at a distance from your relaxed dog. If the dog remains calm, reward him with a treat. Have your friend step close to your dog. If the dog remains calm, reward him again. If the dog becomes negatively aroused, have your friend step back to the original distance. Repeat this exercise until your dog is confident enough to accept a treat from your friend&rsquo;s open hand.</p>
    <p><strong>Herbal treatments for canine aggression and anxiety</strong><br />Canine Matricalm in an all-natural product, loaded with herbs that have been proven to have a calming effect on dogs. It is highly effective, yet it is completely safe, gentle and good for your dog. It is particularly effective when combined with behavioral treatments for canine aggression, as described above.</p>

  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:28
  dosage: |-
    <p>Unwanted hair must first be removed so that the hair follicle and bulb are removed without the hair breaking.</p>
    <p>Using your usual method, remove hair from desired area. Apply Kalo on area to be affected and massage into skin until completely absorbed. Repeat application twice more on the day of hair removal, preferably at 15 minute intervals. Then use lotion 3 times the next day. No further treatment is necessary until the next hair removal session, when the process is repeated.</p>
    <p>The need for hair removal will decrease after each session; results will be evident after four to six hair removal sessions. Kalo, when used regularly after shaving, may dramatically reduce the rate of hair regrowth within three to four weeks.</p>

    <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>How Does The Fountain Increase My Pets Water Intake?</strong><br />How many times does your cat try and drink from the faucet or how many dogs love to drink from the garden hose? In nature, moving water is much fresher than stagnant water. The movement constantly breaks the surface tension of the water and draws oxygen from the air into the water. This process is called aeration and it makes water more appealing to drink. Pets may be drawn by instinct to moving water for this reason. </p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Pet Fountain filters and aerates continuously moving water to keep it much fresher than standing bowl water. Even pets who don't jump on counters to drink from faucets may drink more water using the Fountain. </p>
    <p>Why is this important? Many cats and dogs may not drink as much water as they should. This is one reason the urine becomes so concentrated and predisposes some pets to urinary tract disease, constipation or kidney disease. In particular, cats with urinary tract or kidney disease have a critical need for water to support kidney function or prevent crystal formation and obstruction. </p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Pet Fountain<strong> </strong>is veterinarian designed and recommended by vet urinary specialists. It encourages water intake and proper hydration in healthy pets, and is especially beneficial in pets with kidney or urinary tract disease.</p>
    <p><strong>Health Benefits </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves your pet's health </li>
        <li>Reduces urinary diseases </li>
        <li>Improves the quality of your pet's life </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's simple, safe and proven to benefit your pet's health.. Research shows that one of the best ways to improve your pet's health is to get them to drink more water. And the best way to do that is with the Drinkwell Pet Fountain. By using a 5-inch falling stream of water, the Pet Fountain continually aerates your pet's water with healthful oxygen. A charcoal filter also removes bad tastes and odors, giving your pet the best possible - and most appealing - way to stay hydrated! </p>

    <p><strong>Testimonials<br /></strong>Upon opening the package, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the product. It is well-made, sturdy and odorless. I was really impressed! Kaz is prone to urinary tract infections but now she won't get dehydrated! As far as I'm concerned, you have attained PURRFECTION in this imperfect world. <br /><em>Judy, Alabama</em></p>
    <p>I purchased the Drinkwell Pet Fountain and it is now the only thing my three cats will drink out of. I purchased it because one of my cats had severe kidney failure and it has drastically improved his health and quality of life. It has also stopped my other cat from jumping on the counter and crying for me to turn the sink on. We love the Drinkwell and would recommend it to everyone. <br /><em>John &amp; Cassandra, Maryland</em></p>
    <p>After a painful experience with UTI and bladder crystals, our vet told us our kitty would need to be fed prescription diet for the rest of his life. What a bummer. We heard about the Drinkwell Pet Fountain and invested in it for our kitty's health. Our kitty started drinking copious amounts of water, no prescription diet necessary! I am now a big advocate. Who would want to drink out of a dirty, stagnant bowl anyway? The filtered, aerated water from the Drinkwell is fresh and great.<br /><em>Caleb, California</em></p>
    <p><strong><br />What is Feline Kidney Disease?<br /></strong><span>Mineral deposits and stone formation in the urinary tract are a common cat problem leading to feline kidney failure. Stones cause bladder-lining irritation; if they become too large, they can cause partial or complete urinary blockage. Poor diet, including high sodium (salt) intake is one cause of this condition; it is believed that pets that have excessive mineral content in the diet are more likely to be affected by the problem. When kidney disease is diagnosed, changes in the diet should be implemented immediately; liquids should be increased to help avoid mineral deposit, and sodium (salt) intake should be reduced. Too much sodium increases heart rate which is linked with kidney disease. The use of herbs, such as those found in Feline Tripsy, is recommended to ease the symptoms of cat kidney disease, thereby relieving pain and avoiding infections. </span></p>
    <p><strong>Customer Testimonial</strong><br />&ldquo;All my life I have had cats but before now, none of them have had kidney disease. My current cat, Brit, is a kind, gentle animal who was recently diagnosed with kidney disease. Being a bit of a health food, natural product, environmentally aware kind of girl, my first thought was to seek out some natural products to give to Brit. After a brief search I came across Tripsy on your website. After reading the details and potential benefits I decided this was what I was looking for. I was right! It worked like a charm and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough. Brit is picking up nicely and that tells me Tripsy worked!&rdquo; Angela<br />Lincoln, NE</p>

    <p>  Are you a woman experiencing a low libido?  Well, you're not alone. </p>
    <p> <strong>Female Essence </strong>is an all natural, herbal product designed to address a  problem - that isn't always properly understood  - woman's libido. There are many products on the market formulated to enhance the male sexual experience, but this is one of the few products designed specifically for women.</p>
    <p>Are you feeling like you just don&rsquo;t have the same want or need to have sex? Do you wonder why your once highly sexual relationship has dulled? Female Essence can help!</p>
    <p> Yes, life is busy. But, even when you and your partner DO find the time to be together, you get the feeling that something has really changed in your level of passion and desire. </p>
    <p> Sex isn't everything, but it is important. Sex opens the door for more love with your partner.  Sex refreshes the spirit and brings new life to your relationship.  It&rsquo;s never too late to, low libido is treatable. </p>
    <p> You can have passion again. You can experience the thrill and sexual intensity that you used to have. You can have a more vibrant, more active sex life again. The fire is still in you, it's just waiting for the right spark.</p>
    <p><strong>Female Essence is the spark that can re-ignite your sexual fire.</strong></p>
    <p>  Historically, men were assumed to have a stronger sexual drive than women.  Male and female libidos are as different as they are complex.  In the past, when a man had a low libido, it was medically recognized as impotence and then erectile dysfunction.  Men received validation that a problem existed and received help.  Women, however, were labeled frigid or cold.  Women were judged, not helped.</p>
    <p><strong>Causes of low libido</strong></p>
    <p>  First let's take care of one misconception - a low libido is not a defect - there is nothing wrong with you. </p>
    <p> There can be many different causes for this problem, including:  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hormonal changes in your body </li>
        <li>Stress  like jobs, finances, coworkers, even neighbors </li>
        <li>Onset of menopause </li>
        <li>Major life changes
        <ul>
            <li> Arrival of new children</li>
            <li>Children moving out of the house </li>
            <li>Children moving back in the house</li>
            <li>Elderly family members moving in</li>
            <li>Major location moves</li>
            <li>Death of a family member</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Asians and Europeans have long understood what made a woman's libido function. They used gentle, natural aphrodisiacs to revitalize a woman's body. Making her feel vibrate and sexy again. </p>
    <p> Doctors, using these same natural herbs, have carefully formulated Female Essence to change your life. This is the most effective libido enhancer for women on the market today. Taken daily, this particular formula will boost not only our libido but also your self-confidence, making you feel that much better.</p>
    <p> Female Essence is one of our most popular and highest-reviewed products. This product is gentle, natural, and healthy. There are no negative long-term effects. </p>
    <p> Isn't it time you did something for yourself. Take that first step to improving your life - give yourself a boost with Female Essence.</p>

          <P><font color="006666"><strong>Description<br>
            </strong></font>Feline arthritis is a non-specific term denoting an inflammatory 
            disorder that occurs in the joints, most often affecting the limbs. Any 
            joint injury alters the volume and composition of the joint lubricant 
            (synovial fluid), leading to cartilage destruction as final consequence 
            of the process. It can arise from injury to the bones, infections, autoimmune 
            diseases (immune-mediated arthritis), and the wear and tear of old age 
            (degenerative arthritis). A lameness examination is critical in identifying 
            the lesion. For cats, correct weight according to the breed is an important 
            consideration; if necessary, it must be reduced in order to relieve pain, 
            and to provide a better organic condition. Exercising your pet is an important 
            part of cat arthritis treatment. Also, remember to keep your pet in a 
            warm, quiet, easy corner at home with a firm, orthopedic foam bed. Try 
            to ensure your cat does not have to go up and down stairs, as this will 
            aggravate the condition. The use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms 
            of cat arthritis, and also to improve the immune system.

    <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>How Does The Fountain Increase My Pets Water Intake?</strong><br />How many times does your cat try and drink from the faucet or how many dogs love to drink from the garden hose? In nature, moving water is much fresher than stagnant water. The movement constantly breaks the surface tension of the water and draws oxygen from the air into the water. This process is called aeration and it makes water more appealing to drink. Pets may be drawn by instinct to moving water for this reason. </p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Pet Fountain filters and aerates continuously moving water to keep it much fresher than standing bowl water. Even pets who don't jump on counters to drink from faucets may drink more water using the Fountain. </p>
    <p>Why is this important? Many cats and dogs may not drink as much water as they should. This is one reason the urine becomes so concentrated and predisposes some pets to urinary tract disease, constipation or kidney disease. In particular, cats with urinary tract or kidney disease have a critical need for water to support kidney function or prevent crystal formation and obstruction. </p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Pet Fountain<strong> </strong>is veterinarian designed and recommended by vet urinary specialists. It encourages water intake and proper hydration in healthy pets, and is especially beneficial in pets with kidney or urinary tract disease.</p>
    <p><strong>Health Benefits </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves your pet's health </li>
        <li>Reduces urinary diseases </li>
        <li>Improves the quality of your pet's life </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using a 5-inch falling stream of water, the Pet Fountain continually aerates your pet's water with healthful oxygen. A charcoal filter also removes bad tastes and odors, giving your pet the best possible - and most appealing - way to stay hydrated! </p>
    <strong>Features Of The Fountain </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides pets with an enjoyable &quot;falling stream&quot; of water </li>
        <li>Removes bad tastes and odors with extra large charcoal filter </li>
        <li>Adds more oxygen for freshness </li>
        <li>Easy to maintain </li>
        <li>Helps keep cats off counters and out of sinks </li>
        <li>Patented free falling system </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Testimonials<br /></strong>We have a 104-lbs. female Rottweiler who loves to drink fresh water. She was spoiled as a baby; we used to let her jump in the bathroom tub for drinks! As you can imagine, giving her drinks from the tub each time she jumped in and barked (quite loudly) if you didn't pay attention to her request, got old! She loves your fountain and adapted right to it. I wish we would have had your fountain years ago when we had two large male Rotties. They would have loved it! <br /><em>Valerie, CO </em></p>
    <p>I purchased the Drinkwell Pet Fountain and it is now the only thing my three cats will drink out of. I purchased it because one of my cats had severe kidney failure and it has drastically improved his health and quality of life. It has also stopped my other cat from jumping on the counter and crying for me to turn the sink on. We love the Drinkwell and would recommend it to everyone. <br /><em>John &amp; Cassandra, Maryland</em></p>
    <p>Upon opening the package, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the product. It is well-made, sturdy and odorless. I was really impressed! Kaz is prone to urinary tract infections but now she won't get dehydrated! As far as I'm concerned, you have attained PURRFECTION in this imperfect world. <br /><em>Judy</em>, Alabama</p>
    <p><br /><strong>What is Canine Kidney Disease?<br /></strong>Kidney disease in dogs involves any insult to the kidneys. If the problem persists, it can lead to chronic or acute kidney failure. Chronic kidney failure is one of the major causes of illness and death in older dogs. Most dogs suffering from chronic kidney disease are seven to ten years of age, or older. Kidney stones are mineral deposits that form in a dog&rsquo;s kidneys. They irritate the bladder lining and can even block a dog&rsquo;s urinary tract.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer Testimonial<br /></strong>&ldquo;I am writing to let you know how grateful my family and I are for the Tripsy product we recently got from your website. Our dog Larry is a real member of our family and the kids absolutely love him. Naturally, it is important to keep him healthy. </p>
    <p>When Larry was recently diagnosed with kidney disease, it really upset us all. The kids were distraught and thought he would die. After the vet treated him with a fluid therapy, we were put on to Tripsy and hoped it would help in his healing process. As the last few weeks have passed, Larry has been getting better, looking better and even the vet is pleased with his condition. It is great to know that Larry will be himself again. Thank you from us all.&rdquo; - Liz - Boston, MA</p>
    <p><strong><span>Common Symptoms</span></strong></p>
    <li><span>Your dog&rsquo;s frequency of urination increases</span> </li>
    <li><span>Blood in your dog&rsquo;s urine</span> </li>
    <li><span>Your dog suffers obvious discomfort or pain while urinating</span> </li>
    <li><span>In a severe case, your dog may be unable to urinate</span>
    <p>There are many possible causes of kidney disease in dogs. Certain breeds are more likely to develop kidney disease. Poor diet is often to blame. In particular, dogs placed on a strictly dry diet (or a diet with a high mineral content) are more likely to suffer from kidney disease.</p>
    <p>If your dog is suffering from kidney disease, you should consider changing his diet right away: <br />Increase his intake of liquids to help reduce mineral deposits.</p>
    <p>Ensure your dog is not getting too much salt (sodium). Many commercial brands of dog food contain too much salt.</p>
    <p>Herbal remedies, such as Canine Tripsy, can also be very helpful in fighting the symptoms of canine kidney disease. Canine Tripsy can help your dog fight or avoid kidney infections, and help him deal with the pain and discomfort of canine kidney stones.</p>

    <p>Trilex has the  remarkable ability to break the HSV-1 Virus cycle.&nbsp; This physician formulated herbal supplement helps  to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Purge the body of infections</li>
        <li>Lessen the severity of outbreaks</li>
        <li>Promote a healthy immune system</li>
        <li>Heal the body if an outbreak occurs</li>
        <li>Reduce outbreaks of embarrassing cold  sores</li>
        <li>Help the body rid itself of toxins that  cause viral diseases </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Included in this all natural cold sore remedy is<strong> L-Lysine HCI</strong>, an essential amino acid which helps the body create collagen.  Through the production of collagen the body can maintain and repair the delicate tissue around the mouth.  L-lysine also has been found to reduce the reproduction of the HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) in the body.  It&rsquo;s been reported to lessen the severity of outbreaks and shorten the length of time the outbreak will last. </p>
    <p> Another herb included in this healing remedy is <strong>Chaparral, also known as Folium Larreae</strong>.  Chaparral contains the healing chemical NDGA (nordihydroguaiaretic acid).  NDGA is a natural healing compound found in the Chaparral shrub that has been used in herbal medicine for its ability to kill bacteria and unfriendly microorganisms.<br /> </p>
    <p> Cold sores can often be extremely tender and uncomfortable which can encourage constant touching and further irritation.  This can lead to the cold sore spreading or longer healing times of the afflicted area.  A cold sore can heal faster left untouched and to relieve the pain and discomfort that is often associated cold sores, <strong>Wei Ling Xian (Radix Clematidis Chinensis), also known as Clematis Root</strong>, was added.  Clematis Root promotes the healing of wounds through its remarkable ability to alleviate pain, spasms, numbness and stiffness. </p>
    <p> <strong>Chai Hu (Radix Bupleuri), known as Thorowax Root</strong> is harvested from the Bupleurum plant. Thorwax Root promotes blood circulation and is widely used to aide the liver in the detoxification process.  It relieves and clears heat from the body and promotes proper blood circulation.</p>
    <p> <strong>Dang Gui (Radix Angelicae Sinensis) is Angelica Root</strong> and was added to this cold sore remedy for its ability to decrease swelling and alleviate pain.  Angelica Root commonly used in traditional Chinese medicines for sores and abscesses where breaking blood stagnation is useful.  It also can generate flesh to promote the healing of open sore wounds.</p>
    <p> Also included in Trilex is <strong>Skullcap Root, also called Huang Qin (Radix Scutellariae)</strong>.  Huang Qin works to clear heat and moisturize dryness as it promotes the production of bodily fluids and helps to detoxify the body.</p>
    <p> <strong>Gentian Root, Long Dan Cao (Radix Genitanae Scabrae)</strong>, is in Trilex for its ability to eliminate heat and dampness from the Liver and Gallbladder Channels.  It works to sedate Liver Fire which helps the liver to clear the body of toxins.</p>
    <p> <strong>Licorice Root, also known as Gan Cao (Radix Blyeyrrhizae Uralensis)</strong>, is another herb that is in this all natural supplement that contributes to the healing process.  Glycyrrhizin, a main component in Licorice Root, has been reported to reduce inflammation and soothe irritation.  It&rsquo;s also known for its ability to regulate the stress hormone cortisol. </p>
    <p> <strong>Bai Mao Liang (Rhizoma Hydrastis), also known as Goldenseal</strong> is another healing herb added to this blend.  Native to the Northern United States, Goldenseal is now grown and cultivated on farms in Washington State and Oregon.  This highly sought after herb contains the compound Berberine.  Berberine has been found to naturally destroy many forms of bacteria and germs.  It has also shown to defend the body against fungal infections and bacterial/viral infections too.</p>
    <p> The vegetable <strong>Rubarb, also known as Da Huang (Rhizoma Rhizoma Rhei)</strong>, is in this cold sore remedy for its amazing ability to fight infectious fungi including candida.  Rubarb also drains heat from the body, improves the digestive tract and purges the bowels of unwanted waste products. </p>

    <p><strong>What is Oral Herpes (Cold Sores)?</strong></p>
    <p><img width="88" height="75" align="left" alt="herpes virus image" src="/UserFiles/Image/herpes_simpex_virus-c.jpg" />Cold sores are a viral disease caused by the type 1 strain of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). The virus presents itself as painful blisters containing infectious virus particles. The first outbreak is usually the worst and can last for weeks. Then the virus will go into remission. Subsequent outbreaks tend to be milder in nature and as years pass, they can become less frequent. </p>
    <p>For many people, getting a cold sore or learning they have herpes is devastating. These viruses are, after all, life-long conditions with no cure. However, while it does mean you have to be extra careful, the virus need not rule your life. It is possible to ease the symptoms, speed recovery times and keep outbreaks to an absolute minimum. </p>
    <p><strong>What triggers outbreaks?</strong></p>
    <p>There's a degree of uncertainty here, but outbreaks definitely occur more often when our immune systems are compromised. For instance by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Colds or other illnesses </li>
        <li>Sunburns </li>
        <li>Stress or trauma (including surgery) </li>
        <li>Fatigue or exhaustion </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Traditional treatments for Cold Sores</strong></p>
    <p>Antiviral drugs, such as the oral treatments Aciclovir and Valaciclovir, can reduce breakouts for some people. However, both of these treatments often fail. Also, they often have bothersome side effects including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
    <p><strong>Natural treatments</strong></p>
    <p>Since outbreaks are worst when our immune systems are weak, the best way to handle oral herpes (cold sores) is simply to keep your immune system strong. This can be done naturally by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eating a healthy diet </li>
        <li>Regular exercise </li>
        <li>Getting lots of rest </li>
        <li>Avoiding stressful situations or learning how to handle stress effectively </li>
        <li>Taking herbal supplements like Trilex </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some people experience negative feelings related to the condition following diagnosis. Although there is no cure, controlling the virus and eliminating cold sores from breaking out is your best form of treatment. </p>
    <p>Trilex is among our most popular products for good reason: it works wonderfully! Customers often tell us they can <strong>actually feel it working</strong>. When they get an outbreak, they take a double dose and describe the effect as &quot;like the cold sore is drying up from the inside out&quot;.</p>
    <p>Trilex is a great alternative to harsh prescription drugs. We use only the purest and most effective herbs in our formulas, ensuring safety while producing results. Trilex has been so successful that clinical trials are being planned to expand market penetration.</p>
    <p><strong>Doctor-formulated Doctor recommended </strong></p>
    <p>Trilex was painstakingly formulated by a leading naturopathic doctor. It is gentle yet very effective, safe for long-term use without any of the adverse side effects common with prescription drugs.</p>
    <h3>Our customers have the last word...</h3>
    <p>&quot;This is a fantastic product. I used to get horrible cold sores, sometimes one after another. It was so embarrassing I didn't want to leave my house. After using Trilex during my last outbreak, I was shocked at how quickly and effectively it worked. This is a really great product, thank you so much&quot;<br />Suzanne J., in Danville CA </p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />To: Natural Well Being <br />Dear Sirs:<br />Re: Cold Sore prevention</p>
    <p>I wanted to share with you what effective results &ldquo;Trilex&rdquo; (capsules for cold sores) have provided for me and confirm that Trilex performs as advertised and &ldquo;quickly eliminates cold sores, prevents further outbreaks&rdquo;. </p>
    <p>I have been a chronic sufferer of cold sores in my nostrils for a number of years. It seems that I am also getting cold sores in my eyes and throughout my sinus area and it even affects my hearing. This has all been a very unpleasant experience, to say the least, because of the mucous and moisture there was a case of perpetual eruptions. </p>
    <p>I have been using your product for approximately 6 months. At 3 months I ran out before my next order arrived and I got a series of cold sores for a couple weeks. <br /><br />Trilex has now become a part of my daily regimen and I have been cold sore free for the last 2 months. I am very delighted to have found your product. It really has prevented outbreaks. </p>
    <p>Using Trilex has also relieved my anxiety and apprehension from anticipating a cold sore outbreak when I:<br />- become overtired <br />- become stressed<br />- am in the sun all day golfing or at the cabin<br />- work at the computer and my eyes get fatigued<br />- get dehydrated from working outdoors </p>
    <p>It is quite exciting to feel liberated from that nasty little (energy zapping) virus! </p>
    <p>Sincerely yours,<br />Wendy Horiachka in BC </p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Unless you have lived through the embarrassment of cold sores you wouldn't understand what it does to your confidence. I tried everything and nothing worked until my Doctor recommended your product. After taking it for 3 days I felt an immediate change. Thank you so much.&quot;<br />Richard D., in Centerville</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;I would really like to thank Sheila for her understanding and her GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. I received my order of Trilex the next day and I'm thrilled to report that my cold sores dried up, just like she said they would&quot;<br />Jane M., Denver Co</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Finally a cold sore product that works. Most medications are topical and I hated touching my cold sores. Trilex is effective, fast and all I had to do was take a couple of pills. Great product, thank you&quot;<br />Wendy F., Calgary Al </p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Rarely do people ever talk about how Trilex is herbal - you should mention that more on your site. It's a really great product and it doesn't come with any crazy side effects. That's a huge selling point to me, and I just thought you should be more forthcoming about that.&quot;<br />Elana M., Santa Cruz Ca</p>

Secretions vary depending on the cause; viral \r\n        secretions are generally clear or white whereas bacterial secretions are \r\n        usually yellow or green. The duration of the feline cough varies according \r\n        to the cause, usually lasting 7-10 days when derived from colds or acute \r\n        infections, to up to three weeks when the animal is affected by tracheobronchitis. \r\n        Though usually not a serious illness, it is wise to isolate affected animals \r\n        as some viruses can also affect people and other animals. Herbal infusion \r\n        vaporization helps soothe irritated bronchial mucous membranes and also \r\n        liquefies the secretions, reducing symptoms. \r\n      <p><strong><font color=\"006666\">Ingredients</font></strong><br>\r\n        Colt\xE2\x80\x99s Foot: The flavonoids control coughing, relaxes spasms, soothes \r\n        irritated tissues and reduces inflammation; the lipophilic fraction stimulates \r\n        phagocytosis.</p>\r\n      <p>Marshmallow: anti-inflammatory; controls bacterial infection; soothes \r\n        and softens irritated tissues.</p>\r\n      <p>Plantain: antihistaminic, anti-inflammatory, astringent, expectorant, \r\n        promotes healing and controls bacterial infection.</p>\r\n      <p>Mullein: a mucilaginous herb, soothes and lubricates tissues, and has \r\n        analgesic, expectorant and antiseptic effects.</p>\r\n      <p>Horehound: antiseptic, anti-inflammatory and expectorant; relieves spasms. \r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>Licorice: antitussive, anti-inflammatory, demulcent, expectorant (glycyrrhizin \r\n        actions). </p>\r\n      <p>Lobelia: causes immediate relaxation and expansion of the respiratory \r\n        system, allowing oxygenated blood to flow freely. </p>\r\n      <p>Ginger: antioxidant; anti-inflammatory (inhibition of prostaglandins, \r\n        thromboxane and leucotriene synthesis); inhibits platelet aggregation. \r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>Myrrh: antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, astringent; controls bacterial \r\n        infection and enhances healing.</p>\r\n      <p><font color=\"006666\"><strong>Dosage</strong></font><br>\r\n        To be taken twice daily.

            </strong></font>Feline allergies are the most common ailments affecting 
            pets, due to changed lifestyles (including food) and environment. Cat 
            allergies are the body's abnormal reaction to stimuli caused by many different 
            factors. Allergic reactions can be different from one organism to another, 
            even for the same allergen (agent). Sometimes, these allergens are in 
            ones own body, causing the body to react against itself (e.g. auto-immune 
            diseases). It is important to try to find the cause for pet allergies, 
            even though it is not easy. Along with working towards finding the cause, 
            the use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms, and also to improve 
            the immune system.

    <p><strong><br /> </strong><strong>What is Canine Arthritis?</strong><br /> Dogs frequently suffer from   arthritis. If your pet has this disease, his joints will become inflamed   (swollen) and painful as the cartilage and connective tissues of his joints   slowly break down. </p>
    <p>Warning signs that your dog is suffering from arthritis include a reluctance   to stand up or climb stairs. Other telltale signs of canine arthritis   include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your dog favors one side of his body </li>
        <li>Limping, especially when he first gets up </li>
        <li>Swollen joints (especially the hips) </li>
        <li>Reduced appetite </li>
        <li>Aversion to being touched or petted </li>
        <li>Your dog loses interest in activities he previously enjoyed: running,   swimming, playing, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Large breeds of dogs tend to suffer from arthritis more often than smaller breeds. This is probably due simply to the extra weight and stress on the joints of larger breeds. What&rsquo;s less clear is why purebred dogs &ndash; particularly males &ndash;   suffer from canine arthritis more often than mixed breeds.</p>
    <p><strong>How Nupro Joint Support Supplement Helps </strong></p>
    <p>Nupro is made with fresh quality health food ingredients that are human-grade, not animal-grade. It contains a full range of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, and essential fatty acids in their natural raw forms. The specific joint support ingreedients are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Glucosamine Complex</strong> (500 mg. per   scoop) is a special formula that is an easily absorbed natural substance   that stimulates the production of proteoglycans which help to maintain the   health and resiliency of connective tissues and restores the damaged cells of   cartilage tissue. Glucosamine complex helps promote the synovial fluid that   lubricates the joints.</li>
        <li> <strong>MSM</strong> (300 mg. per scoop) is a natural source of   bioavailable sulfur, essential for the growth and repair of tendons, cartilage   and other connective tissues. MSM is also an anti-inflammatory agent.</li>
        <li><strong>Ester-C</strong> Chelated Mineral Blend (300 mg. per   scoop) boosts the absorption of the glucosamine complex and MSM and promotes   collagen formation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Customer Testimonial</strong><br /> Hello,<br />I was thrilled to have the opportunity to speak with you on   the phone today. I would like to let you know a little bit about my experience   with Nupro. I have a 13 year old Miniature Schnauzer, Schnoppie, that I have had   her entire life (my first child). About 3 years ago she was stricken with   terrible arthritis, with horrible shakes, with periods of time that she couldn't   move and I knew she was very uncomfortable. My husband and I had to have that   serious discussion about her quality of life. After the tears and the   realization we started looking and hoping for an alternative. We were introduced   to Nupro through a breeder that we purchased a Giant Schnauzer from. Part of the   agreement in purchasing this dog was to keep him on the Nupro. We started   Schnoppie on your product following the instructions on the dosage. Within a   month her shaking had subsided, she was a lot more lively, her arthritis seemed   to be much better. This was everything we had hoped for but, we received more   with the Nupro product. Schnoppie had a new layer of thick soft hair growing,   her skin had always been itchy and dry, not anymore, and her beautiftil little   eyes that had been so cloudy and sad were suddenly alert, clear and   happy.</p>
    <p>Schnoppie is still an older dog that needs special attention   (mostly love). However, I knew she is a much happier dog by the way she looks   and her excitement for life. Grady, our three year old Giant Schnauzer, has been   on your product all of his life. He is the most healthy, shiny, fit animal you   will ever see. We love our animals and want you to know how much we appreciate   your product that keeps them at their best.<br />   A very happy customer<br /> Shauna</p>
    <p>Hello,<br />   I just wanted to take a moment to say 'thank you'.  I ordered the Nupro Joint Support for my 5 year old rottie girl, Sable, a few weeks ago.  I belong to a yahoo group and many there told me this is amazing.  Sable is a 5 yo rottie who sadly was kept indoors her whole life (never saw the light of day).  She is a big girl, at 100 pounds (down from 110 when we got her the day after this past Thanksgiving).  Her back end was very underdeveloped due to lack of excercise.  She had been having alot  of problems getting up (very stiff) and sometimes when up on the couch, when she shifted positions, she would yelp.  Also, she had been sleeping up in bed with us, but had not been able to get up there for a while now (and would not allow you to help her, growled if you touched her back end.)  Also, we had gotten a new pup and she really would growl and snap at him if he came near her, especially that back end. <br />   <br />   I started her on the Nupro a little over two weeks ago and to say the difference in her is amazing is an understatement!  She is back up in bed with us at night, gets up with no problems, have not heard any crying and best of all, she is PLAYING with the puppy!  Even grabbing toys and making him chase her!  And RUNNING around the backyard like a little puppy!  I was in tears the first time I saw her do that!!  And as if that weren't enough, she had a bad case of dandruff......ALL GONE! <br />   <br />   I have put my other two on it (2 yo rottie boy, and 16 week old rottie pup).  They LOVE IT! I wish I had know about this product before.  I had a rottie boy with pretty severe h/d and I know this would have helped him.  <br />   <br />   Anyway, thank you for helping me to help my sweet girl to enjoy life again (and also for giving my other two a great way to stay in good shape!)  I would recommend your product to anyone without hesitation.  As a matter of fact, I still belong to a group about canine bone cancer.  I am sure many would be interested in adding this product to their pets diets, as being a tripod can really mess with their joints. <br />   <br />   <img height="300" width="400" src="/images/customers/ShowLetter.jpg" alt="" /></p>

    <p>A common problem that occurs with shaving is known as Pseudofolliculitis Barbae. It is better known as ingrown hair or razor bumps. What happens is that hair normally has a tapered tip; however, when you shave the tip is removed from the hair shaft and the growing hairs start feeling bristly.</p>
    <p>As the hair tip begins to re-grow, its sharpness will cause it to penetrate under the skin surrounding the follicle. Inflammation and irritation generally result from this. This is the phenomenon that causes ingrown hairs, razor bumps and irritation.</p>
    <p>Kalo Ingrown Hair Treatment combats this phenomenon by exfoliating the outer dermal layer of skin while adding elasticity to the newly exposed hair. Little by little it liberates the trapped hair from under the skin allowing it to be safely released.</p>

    <p><strong>More About Toenail Fungus &ndash; And Fungus No More</strong></p>
    <p>Will Fungus No More cure my finger and toenail fungus? Yes, because Fungus No More is an <strong>FDA approved fingernail and toenail fungus killer.</strong></p>
    <p>Fungus does not &quot;live&quot; in finger or toenails since these nails are made up of dead cells. It&rsquo;s the fungus in the surrounding live tissue that causes the nails to grow thick, yellow, and brittle. Fungus No More does not penetrate the finger or toenail itself. Rather, it effectively <strong>kills the fungal infection in the surrounding tissues</strong>, allowing the new nail growth to be healthy and clean in appearance.</p>
    <p>Use the easy brush applicator to target the problem areas without messy creams or droppers. Since you do not have to touch the affected finger or toenail, Fungus No More helps keep the fungus from spreading to other fingers or toenails.</p>
    <p>Fungus No More is also proven clinically to be effective in the treatment of athlete&rsquo;s foot, and ringworm affecting the skin under and around the finger and toenail.</p>

    <p><strong>What are cat ear mites?</strong></p>
    <p>Mites spend most of their life living inside your cat&rsquo;s ear. Because outward signs are not always apparent, it is important to have your vet check your cat&rsquo;s ears at each regular check up. If untreated, cat ear mites can cause cat ear infection because bacteria will have access to the ear tissue through holes made by the mites. Because the cat ear mites are irritating, many cats will scratch which can cause reinfestation through the paws or tail. Continued scratching can lead to bald patches where hair is torn out and even bleeding. At worst, the infection can spread to the brain, where it can even cause convulsions or death.</p>

    <p><strong>Ceramide-C: Anti-Wrinkle, Anti-Aging Capsules</strong></p>
    <p>Ceramide is a natural component of the human skin. It&rsquo;s critical to the skin's good health and youthful appearance. But as we grow old, skin naturally loses ceramide, making it more vulnerable to the signs of aging.</p>
    <p>It has recently been shown that by replenishing the skin&rsquo;s supply of Ceramide &ndash; as well as vitamins A, C and E &ndash; your skin can be rejuvenated!</p>
    <p>But there was a challenge: ceramide is unstable and oxidizes quickly when exposed to air.</p>
    <p>Our elegant solution was to package this formulation in small capsules, each containing one daily application.</p>
    <p>Each capsule is enough to cover the entire face, throat, upper chest and both hands. Ceramide-C capsules are highly concentrated to deliver the most advanced ingredients.</p>

    <p><strong>About cancer in dogs</strong><br />There are many forms of canine cancer. But just as in human cancer, dog cancer is defined by an uncontrolled growth of cells. These malignant (harmful) cells form tumors and destroy healthy cells. They can then spread to other parts of your dog&rsquo;s body through the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>Learn more about <a href="http://pethealth.petwellbeing.com/dog_cancer/">dog cancer</a> in the PetWellbeing.com learning center. </p>
    <p>Some of the symptoms of canine cancer are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduction of your dog&rsquo;s energy level </li>
        <li>Stiffness </li>
        <li>Difficulty breathing </li>
        <li>Sores that don&rsquo;t heal </li>
        <li>Discharge or bleeding from any body opening </li>
        <li>Lumps or that get bigger and do not go away </li>
        <li>Any difficulty your dog has in urinating or defecating </li>
        <li>Unusual foul odors </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dogs can suffer from any different types of cancer. In older dogs, skin cancer is very common. Most skin tumors are benign (harmless), but if you spot a lump on your dog&rsquo;s skin, you should have your vet check it out.</p>
    <p>Breast cancers are also common in dogs, and are generally more dangerous. About half of breast tumors are malignant. If you have had your female dog spayed at 6 &ndash; 12 months of age, breast cancer is less likely to develop in her lifetime.</p>
    <p>Mouth cancer is quite common in dogs (more so than in cats). Telltale signs include unusually bad breath, bleeding or swelling in your dog&rsquo;s nose, and difficulty eating.</p>
    <p>Other forms of canine cancer include lymphoma, abdominal tumors (look for lumps on your dog&rsquo;s belly), testicle tumors and bone tumors.</p>
    <p><strong>What is in the Cancer Fighting Kit?</strong></p>
    <p>The cancer fighting kit contains ES Clear and Nu-Pet Antioxidant Wafers. </p>
    <p><strong>ES Clear</strong><br />ES Clear is our top cancer treatment. This grouping of four herbs has been used for many years and helps to boost your dog's immune system and detoxify their body. Canine ES Clear contains herbs which may help purify your dog&rsquo;s blood and reduce the growth of cancerous tumors. It also helps bolster your dog&rsquo;s natural defenses and eases his discomfort.</p>
    <p><strong>Nu-Pet Antioxidant Wafers (and why your dog may need an additional supplement) </strong><br />Nu-Pet Wafers are an excellent companion product for ES Clear. This grouping of grasses and vitamins help to protect against free radicals that can cause cellular damage to your dog. The added nutrients also ensure that your dog's diet is supplemented in the time when his body needs it the most. </p>

    <p>Cancer is currently a leading cause of death in dogs. When received, this is a devastating diagnosis, but there is still hope. Some cancers that are caught early on are treatable. Even in later stage cancer there is an opportunity to diminish the debilitating symptoms of cancer like lethargy, wasting (weight loss), and lack of appetite. The goal needs to be not only extending your pets life but helping improve the quality of their life.</p>

    <p><strong>What is Feline Arthritis?</strong></p>
    <p>Feline arthritis is any inflammation of the joints including a breakdown in the cartilage cushioning the joints. Cats may become more sensitive to exercise, walking up and down stairs and being touched. Cat arthritis has a variety of causes including previous bone injury, infections, autoimmune diseases and old age. A veterinary examination is critical in identifying the problem. Correct body weight and regular exercise are both key to cat arthritis treatment. Also, remember to keep your cat in a warm, quiet corner at home with a firm, orthopedic foam bed. Try to ensure your cat does not have to go up and down stairs, as this will aggravate the condition. The use of herbs such as those found in Feline Old Timer is recommended to ease the symptoms of cat arthritis, and also to improve the immune system.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Symptoms of Cat Arthritis</strong></p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Weakness </li>
        <li>Limb swelling </li>

    <p><strong>What is Canine Skin Irritation?</strong></p>
    <p>Dog skin irritations and disease are the most common pet ailments. A healthy dog has bright, odorless hair and skin, free of debris, grease and irritation. A dog&rsquo;s skin may be irritated if it has a rash, is dry and/or flaking, greasy, red, or itchy. The causes can be numerous from food allergies to fleas and ticks and other irritants. If your dog vomits after a meal, this is an indication that he may have a food allergy. Dog owners should pay close attention to the dog&rsquo;s environment such as its bed or sleeping space which should be cleaned or changed frequently. Regardless of the cause, the healing herbal treatment found in Canine All Clear Ointment can be helpful in clearing the dog skin irritation.</p>

    <p><strong>Why does your dog need a dietary supplement? </strong><br />The processing practice of most of the commercial pet foods involve high heats, cooking, rendering, freezing, dehydrating, canning, extruding, pelleting, and so forth. Processing meat and by-products used in pet food can greatly diminish or even destroy their nutritional value. </p>
    <p>Many of the commercial brands of dog food are not well-balanced and do not provide all the nutrients for a healthy system and body. A lifetime spent on these foods can be starving your dog of vital nutrients. Both healthy and ailing dogs can benefit from the addition of nutritional supplements. </p>
    <p>NUPRO is made with fresh quality health food ingredients that are human-grade, not animal-grade. Contains a full range of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, and essential fatty acids in their natural raw forms. Whether you use commercial diets, or cook for your animals, a supplement is an essential part of your daily nutritional program.</p>

    <p>Hi, my name is Randy from East Point, GA. This morning while getting ready for work, my Corgi &quot;Marty&quot; got a hold of my empty jar of Nupro, and proceeded to get his head stuck in the jar! I couldn't get it off, so I went to the garage and got some wire cutters and cut through the plastic. Attached is a picture of him I quickly took with my digital camera. I couldn't help but laugh, he looked so pitiful with that jar on his head! I thought you might find this funny...I guess it's quite a testimony to your product! ;)<br />Sincerely, Randy</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#800000">Customer Testimonial<br /></font></strong>Hello,<br />This is one of the rare times I&rsquo;ve sat down to write a letter of appreciation for a product. I&rsquo;ve been doing rescue work with animals for almost fifteen years, and over the course of time I&rsquo;ve learned how imperative good nutrition is to an animal&rsquo;s health (especially to the abused and neglected pets who have come my way). I try to use only natural, holistic care for the animals, and one product that&rsquo;s a basic part of the program is Nupro. This is such a high quality, well balanced supplement, incorporating exactly the right mixture of nutrients. I used to buy many of the same supplements individually at a much higher over-all price! And the results are apparent in just a matter of weeks, even in animals with long term skin and health problems.<br />A perfect example is Zoe, a dog that was just recently turned in because her owner was tired of dealing with her skin condition. She was suffering from terrible allergies, was almost bald, covered in sores and hot spots, itched constantly, and had a severe ear infection. Her owner had been treating her for almost a year with antibiotics, steroids, and chemicals dips and baths. I immediately took her off those treatments, put her on a natural (no by-products, no preserves) dog food, and added Nupro (plus some herbs to boost her immune system). It&rsquo;s now been just over one month, and not only has her skin cleared up completely, but her fur is starting to come in silky soft and her ears have healed! She&rsquo;s bright eyed, full of energy, and will soon be ready for adoption!<br />I&rsquo;ve been giving out samples of Nupro with each adoption and will continue to encourage everyone to try this supplement for their pets. Thank you for such a quality product!</p>
    <p>Sincerely, Lori</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#800000">Customer Testimonial<br /></font></strong>I would like to relate a bit of my experience with Nupro. I have two Rottweilers, both rescues, who have been on Nupro since January of this year. Maia (approximately 1 year old female) was VERY underweight and had been through some physical abuse. Bear (4 year old male) had been starved and severely abused. I immediately put them on the Nupro mixed with water in their kibble, when they came home with me. The difference in them not only physically, but temperamentally has been nothing short of wonderful. When I say temperament, I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that they were vicious, in fact quite the opposite, they were both very nervous and frankly scared. But lots of love, patience, consistency, and an excellent diet (which includes Nupro at every meal) has them in wonderful condition. </p>
    <p>Maia was a very slim 50.5 lbs when she came to me. She&rsquo;s now a very healthy 65 lbs (and gaining), beautiful muscle-tone, and a personality that just lights up a room! Bear&rsquo;s weight was pretty good when he came to me, but his coat was a MESS! Now his coat is beautiful. He plays like a puppy, and he&rsquo;s steady as a rock. He&rsquo;s also about 110 lbs these days!</p>
    <p>I can say that I will not be without Nupro for my &quot;babies&quot;, and recommend it enthusiastically. Bear and Maia would too, since they wolf it down! Many thanks, and I look forward to speaking with you again.<br /><br />Regards, Lois</p>

    <p><strong>What is Feline Skin Irritation?</strong></p>
    <p>Skin irritations and disorders are the most common cat ailments. A healthy animal has bright, odorless hair and skin, free of debris, grease and irritation. A cat&rsquo;s skin may be irritated if it has a rash, is dry and/or flaking, greasy, red, or itchy. The causes can be numerous from food allergies to fleas and ticks and other irritants. If your pet vomits after a meal, this is an indication that he may have a food allergy. Pet owners should pay close attention to the pet&rsquo;s environment such as his bed or sleeping space which should be cleaned or changed frequently. Regardless of the cause, the healing herbal treatment found in Feline All Clear Ointment can be helpful in clearing the irritation.</p>

    <p><strong>What are dog ear mites?</strong><br />Dog ear mites are extremely common. They are tiny insects that spend most of their lives inside your dog&rsquo;s ear. As they&rsquo;re too small to be seen with the naked eye, ear mites are easily missed. Often, their waste material is visible, however. It looks rather like fine coffee grounds. </p>
    <p>Learn more about <a target="_blank" href="http://pethealth.petwellbeing.com/dog_ear_mites/">dog ear mites</a> in the PetWellbeing.com learning center. </p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms of Dog Ear Mites</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frequent shaking of head </li>
        <li>Scratching of ears </li>
        <li>Dark substance in ears (like sticky coffee grounds) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ear mites are irritating; dogs can&rsquo;t resist scratching them. Of course, this only serves to make matters worse: in severe cases, bald patches and even bleeding can occur. </p>
    <p>Make sure your vet checks your dog&rsquo;s ears for mites whenever you take your dog in for a checkup. Left untreated, ear mites can cause infections. If the infection spreads to the brain, it&rsquo;s even possible that convulsions or death can result.</p>
    <p>Canine Ear Clear drops are a safe and effective treatment for ear mites and it's simple to administer. For your convenience we offer next day UPS (some restrictions apply). Ear Clear drops can also be used in a preventative manner. </p>

    <p><strong><br />Why does your cat need a dietary supplement? </strong><br />The processing practice of most of the commercial pet foods involve high heats, cooking, rendering, freezing, dehydrating, canning, extruding, pelleting, and so forth. Processing meat and by-products used in pet food can greatly diminish or even destroy their nutritional value. </p>
    <p>Many of the commercial brands of cat food are not well-balanced and do not provide all the nutrients for a healthy system and body. A lifetime spent on these foods can be starving your cat of vital nutrients. Both healthy and ailing cats can benefit from the addition of nutritional supplements. </p>
    <p>Nupro is made with fresh quality health food ingredients that are human-grade, not animal-grade. Contains a full range of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, and essential fatty acids in their natural raw forms. Whether you use commercial diets, or cook for your animals, a supplement is an essential part of your daily nutritional program.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer Testimonial</strong><br />Hello,<br />I have been giving Nupro to my four dogs for 3 years now. I got such wonderful results with allergies, arthritis, coat condition, and over all health, I started giving it to our cat Shpookas. Shpookas is 15 years old and up to about a year ago was in fine health. However in the past year his heart murmur has started to effect his over all health. His immune system had started to fail. He was getting eye infections and other mysterious wasting disorders. He was losing weight,strength, and enthusiasm. We thought he was on his way out. I started mixing the cat Nupro in with a package of Whiskas at night.He had only been allowed Science Diet kibble up to this point, but I figured the old guy deserved a break.Within a month he had gained back all his weight,and his dull sick coat came back to it's former luster. Not only that, he started hunting again,presenting me with little furry presents in the morning. He has also started playing again,attacking me as I come up the stairs,biting my toes when I come out of the shower. He's even taken on Robbie our Great Dane,reminding him who's still boss.</p>
    <p>Shpookas is a bit of a finicky eater so I was surprised he would eat the Nupro. But I am also delighted. It has given his immune system just the boost he needed,so hopefully his remaining years will be a better quality. If you already use Nupro with your dog(s) and you have a cat,especially an ailing one you should give it a try.<br />Kearney, Boston, MA</p>

    <p>When arteries are filled with bad cholesterol, it can cause coronary heart diseases including angina and heart attacks. Good cholesterol carries bad cholesterol to the liver where it is broken down and becomes harmless.</p>
    <p>The three active ingredients in Lipo Guard are Niacin, Choline, and Inositol. Niacin is a well-researched ingredient, proven to lower cholesterol. It does this by speeding the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats and proteins to help weight loss.</p>
    <p>Choline helps break down fat and cholesterol, reduces risk of cardiovascular disease, and lowers blood pressure.</p>
    <p>The vitamin Inositol can help reduce cholesterol levels. It also helps prevent Arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) which occurs when plaque builds on the artery walls.</p>

    <p><strong>What are dog ear infections?</strong></p>
    <p>If your dog frequently shakes his head or scratches his ears compulsively, he may have a canine ear infection. </p>
    <p> Especially susceptible to ear infections are breeds with long, floppy and hairy ears: schnauzers, cocker spaniels, retrievers, etc. </p>
    <p> Canine ear infections can be caused by water (which is why dogs that enjoy swimming are more likely to get them), allergies, excessive buildup of ear wax, or foreign bodies like seeds in the ear. Another common cause is parasitic insects such as ear mites.</p>
    <p> When infected, your dog&rsquo;s ear will become inflamed and may discharge a black or yellowish fluid. There may also be a foul odor. Ear infections can be irritating and painful; your dog may show his discomfort by obsessively shaking his head, scratching his ears, or rubbing them against furniture&hellip; or your leg!</p>
    <p><strong> Common symptoms of dog ear infection:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Frequent scratching of ears and shaking of head</li>
        <li>Possible whining, obvious discomfort</li>
        <li>A foul-smelling, pus-filled yellowish or dark discharge</li>
        <li>Dark-colored debris in ear, similar to fine coffee grounds </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <strong>How to avoid and/or treat canine ear infections</strong></p>
    <p> The first line of defense against dog ear infections is to keep your dog&rsquo;s ears clean. If your dog is prone to ear infections, it&rsquo;s also helpful to keep him out of water, as water in the ear tends to make infections worse. (Of course, it can be difficult to keep dogs such as Labrador retrievers out of the water. Just know that swimming can make the problem worse and try to keep your dog&rsquo;s ears clean and dry whenever possible.)</p>
    <p> Infections of the ear can be very painful for dogs. Applying a warm, dry compress can help, as can the herbs contained in Canine Echo Gold.</p>
    <p><strong> How does Canine Echo Gold fight ear infections?</strong></p>
    <p> Canine Echo gold was carefully formulated by a leading naturopathic veterinarian. It contains no harsh chemicals, and is loaded with natural herbal extracts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Antibiotic action fights ear infections</li>
        <li>Anti-inflammatory and analgesic action reduces pain</li>
        <li>Relieves itching</li>
        <li>Prevents reoccurrence of ear infections</li>
        <li>Won&rsquo;t irritate sensitive skin</li>
        <li>Safe for long-term, preventative use</li>
    </ul>
    <p>  <strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong></p>
    <p> &quot;I must say, this stuff [Echo Gold] really works! My good pal, Chase, was always getting ear infections, so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. Not only did it clear up his ear infection, but since I started applying it every now and then as a precaution, the infection has never come back! I'm happy, and so is Chase!&quot; Gord, NY</p>

    <p><strong><br /> </strong><strong>What is Canine Arthritis?</strong><br /> Dogs frequently suffer from   arthritis. If your pet has this disease, his joints will become inflamed   (swollen) and painful as the cartilage and connective tissues of his joints   slowly break down. </p>
    <p>Warning signs that your dog is suffering from arthritis include a reluctance   to stand up or climb stairs. Other telltale signs of canine arthritis   include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your dog favors one side of his body </li>
        <li>Limping, especially when he first gets up </li>
        <li>Swollen joints (especially the hips) </li>
        <li>Reduced appetite </li>
        <li>Aversion to being touched or petted </li>
        <li>Your dog loses interest in activities he previously enjoyed: running,   swimming, playing, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Large breeds of dogs tend to suffer from arthritis more often than smaller   breeds. This is probably due simply to the extra weight and stress on the joints   of larger breeds. What&rsquo;s less clear is why purebred dogs &ndash; particularly males &ndash;   suffer from canine arthritis more often than mixed breeds.</p>
    <p><strong>How Nupro Joint Support Supplement Helps </strong></p>
    <p>Nupro is made with fresh quality health food ingredients that are human-grade, not animal-grade. It contains a full range of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, and essential fatty acids in their natural raw forms. The specific joint support ingreedients are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Glucosamine Complex</strong> (500 mg. per   scoop) is a special formula that is an easily absorbed natural substance   that stimulates the production of proteoglycans which help to maintain the   health and resiliency of connective tissues and restores the damaged cells of   cartilage tissue. Glucosamine complex helps promote the synovial fluid that   lubricates the joints.</li>
        <li> <strong>MSM</strong> (300 mg. per scoop) is a natural source of   bioavailable sulfur, essential for the growth and repair of tendons, cartilage   and other connective tissues. MSM is also an anti-inflammatory agent.</li>
        <li><strong>Ester-C</strong> Chelated Mineral Blend (300 mg. per   scoop) boosts the absorption of the glucosamine complex and MSM and promotes   collagen formation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Customer Testimonial</strong><br /> Hello,<br />I was thrilled to have the opportunity to speak with you on   the phone today. I would like to let you know a little bit about my experience   with Nupro. I have a 13 year old Miniature Schnauzer, Schnoppie, that I have had   her entire life (my first child). About 3 years ago she was stricken with   terrible arthritis, with horrible shakes, with periods of time that she couldn't   move and I knew she was very uncomfortable. My husband and I had to have that   serious discussion about her quality of life. After the tears and the   realization we started looking and hoping for an alternative. We were introduced   to Nupro through a breeder that we purchased a Giant Schnauzer from. Part of the   agreement in purchasing this dog was to keep him on the Nupro. We started   Schnoppie on your product following the instructions on the dosage. Within a   month her shaking had subsided, she was a lot more lively, her arthritis seemed   to be much better. This was everything we had hoped for but, we received more   with the Nupro product. Schnoppie had a new layer of thick soft hair growing,   her skin had always been itchy and dry, not anymore, and her beautiftil little   eyes that had been so cloudy and sad were suddenly alert, clear and   happy.</p>
    <p>Schnoppie is still an older dog that needs special attention   (mostly love). However, I knew she is a much happier dog by the way she looks   and her excitement for life. Grady, our three year old Giant Schnauzer, has been   on your product all of his life. He is the most healthy, shiny, fit animal you   will ever see. We love our animals and want you to know how much we appreciate   your product that keeps them at their best.<br />   A very happy customer<br /> Shauna</p>
    <p>Hello,<br />   I just wanted to take a moment to say 'thank you'.  I ordered the Nupro Joint Support for my 5 year old rottie girl, Sable, a few weeks ago.  I belong to a yahoo group and many there told me this is amazing.  Sable is a 5 yo rottie who sadly was kept indoors her whole life (never saw the light of day).  She is a big girl, at 100 pounds (down from 110 when we got her the day after this past Thanksgiving).  Her back end was very underdeveloped due to lack of excercise.  She had been having alot  of problems getting up (very stiff) and sometimes when up on the couch, when she shifted positions, she would yelp.  Also, she had been sleeping up in bed with us, but had not been able to get up there for a while now (and would not allow you to help her, growled if you touched her back end.)  Also, we had gotten a new pup and she really would growl and snap at him if he came near her, especially that back end. <br />   <br />   I started her on the Nupro a little over two weeks ago and to say the difference in her is amazing is an understatement!  She is back up in bed with us at night, gets up with no problems, have not heard any crying and best of all, she is PLAYING with the puppy!  Even grabbing toys and making him chase her!  And RUNNING around the backyard like a little puppy!  I was in tears the first time I saw her do that!!  And as if that weren't enough, she had a bad case of dandruff......ALL GONE! <br />   <br />   I have put my other two on it (2 yo rottie boy, and 16 week old rottie pup).  They LOVE IT! I wish I had know about this product before.  I had a rottie boy with pretty severe h/d and I know this would have helped him.  <br />   <br />   Anyway, thank you for helping me to help my sweet girl to enjoy life again (and also for giving my other two a great way to stay in good shape!)  I would recommend your product to anyone without hesitation.  As a matter of fact, I still belong to a group about canine bone cancer.  I am sure many would be interested in adding this product to their pets diets, as being a tripod can really mess with their joints. <br />   <br />   <img height="300" width="400" alt="" src="/images/customers/ShowLetter.jpg" /></p>
    <p>Thank you again, <br />   Mary,Essex, MA </p>

    <p><strong>  What are cat ear infections</strong></p>
    <p>If your cat frequently shakes her head or scratches her ears compulsively, she may have a feline ear infection. Though not as common in cats as in dogs (dogs with floppy ears are particularly likely to get ear infections), ear infections are still a persistent problem, especially among Persian cats.</p>
    <p> Unlike the case with humans (where ear infections usually start from within) ear infections in dogs and cats are usually caused by external factors: water, allergens, or foreign bodies like seeds in the ear. Another common cause is parasitic insects, particularly ear mites.</p>
    <p> When infected, your cat's ears may become inflamed and may even discharge a black or yellowish fluid. There may also be a foul odor. Ear infections can be irritating and painful; your cat may show her discomfort by obsessively shaking her head, scratching her ears, or rubbing them against furniture... or your leg!</p>
    <p><strong>Common symptoms of cat ear infection:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frequent scratching of ears and shaking of head</li>
        <li>Possible mewling, obvious discomfort</li>
        <li>Dark-colored debris in ear (similar to fine coffee grounds), a sign of ear mites</li>
        <li>In extreme cases, a foul-smelling, pus-filled yellowish or dark discharge </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> How does Feline Echo Gold fight ear infections?</strong></p>
    <p> Feline Echo gold was carefully formulated by a leading naturopathic veterinarian. It contains no harsh chemicals, and is loaded with natural herbal extracts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Antibiotic action fights ear infections</li>
        <li>Anti-inflammatory and analgesic action reduces pain</li>
        <li>Relieves itching</li>
        <li>Prevents reoccurrence of ear infections</li>
        <li>Won't irritate sensitive skin</li>
        <li>Safe for long-term, preventative use</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong> Our customers have the last word...</strong></p>
    <p> &quot;Thanks for the quick service and good advice. My order of Echo Gold arrived very quickly. I immediately started using it on my infected cat, and she seems much more comfortable. I enclose a photo of my happy roommate!&quot; Linda, Brooklyn NY</p>

        <li>Combines the finest, research grade ingredients, including Aminexil&reg; </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>Spectral DNC&reg; is a new medication that incorporates Aminexil&reg; a new, breakthrough compound which is the only other molecule aside from Minoxidil that is clinically proven to re-grow hair. Other active ingredients include research grade Minoxidil 5%, Retinol, copper peptides, and a vitamin and mineral complex. The active ingredients are delivered in a technologically advanced vehicle, in tiny micro-spheres called nanosomes.</p>
    <p>A major advantage of Spectral DNC&reg; is that the active ingredients are encapsulated in nanosomes. Nanosomes are micro-spheres that are 200 times smaller then human cells and penetrate into the deepest layers of the skin and release the active ingredients gradually over a 15 hour period. This technology dramatically boosts the effectiveness of the active ingredients since they are absorbed much deeper in the skin. Spectral DNC&reg; is faster and more effective then Rogaine&reg; and Spectral DNC&reg; works both on the vertex of the head and the frontal hair line. Spectral DNC&reg; gives the best chance of growing normally thick and healthy hair and works on people who previously did not respond to Rogaine&reg; treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>About Cat Cancer </strong></p>
    <p>Your cat is a part of your family; discovering she has cancer is devastating. The best way to handle it is to <strong>take action</strong>. Learn as much as you can about your cat&rsquo;s cancer. Find out how to give her the best possible care. </p>
    <p>Talk to your vet about available treatments. For some types of cancers, conventional treatments are quite effective (though often harsh and with severe side effects). </p>
    <p>Alternative remedies have also proven highly effective in treating cat cancer. These treatments &ndash; including natural remedies like ES Clear &ndash; can be used on their own, or to support conventional cancer treatments. So please consider carefully what would be most suitable for your cat. </p>
    <p>Your goal should be to develop a total treatment plan for your cat. Such a plan will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give your cat the <strong>best possible chance of beating cancer</strong> </li>
        <li>Keep your cat as <strong>comfortable and pain-free</strong> as possible </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The exact causes of cat cancer are unknown. It is partly genetic, but there are also know contributing factors such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diet (e.g. food colorings, food additives, poor nutrition) </li>
        <li>Environment (air and water pollution, etc.) </li>
        <li>Stress and advanced age </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these factors can damage your cat&rsquo;s immune system, weakening her body's natural ability to fight cancerous cells.</p>
    <p><strong>Keep your cat&rsquo;s immune system strong</strong> and you will help reduce the risk that your cat&rsquo;s cancer will spread to healthy tissue. You will also help keep your cat comfortable and happy.</p>
    <p><strong>What is ES Clear for Cat Cancer?</strong></p>
    <p>ES clear is a unique combination of specially-selected herbal extracts, painstakingly formulated by a leading naturopathic vet.</p>
    <p>The herbs in ES Clear have been used for centuries in traditional medicine. They have been show to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slow the growth of cancerous tumors </li>
        <li>Reduce or prevent the spread of cancer to surrounding cells </li>
        <li>Strengthen a cat&rsquo;s immune system </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Will ES Clear cure my cat&rsquo;s cancer?</strong></p>
    <p>There is no sure-fire cure for cancer, in cats or in humans. So for us to claim that ES Clear will cure your cat&rsquo;s cancer would be irresponsible.</p>
    <p>What we can state with confidence, is that the herbs in ES Clear have shown excellent results in treating cat cancer, particularly when used as a part of a comprehensive treatment program. Also, <strong>our customers are telling us it works</strong>. See just a few of their testimonials below. </p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;My 12 year old American Shorthair, Jaguar, was diagnosed with a mast cell tumor of the skin. It was resected and then recurred less than three weeks after surgery. He was hiding under the bed, eating very little, loosing weight, vomiting, wouldn't jump up to the sink to drink water and was very listless. I actually considered putting him to sleep one really bad weekend. Then by chance I came across the ES Clear and ordered it. That was 5 months ago and &quot;Jag&quot; is doing famously. He plays outside, jumps up on the sink for water, has a great appetite, fights with his sibling (Ceasar), and chases my feet under the blankets. He really is &quot;his old self&quot; again. I have never been more amazed at a product than the ES Clear. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a cat diagnosed with cancer. I am a nurse at a large hospital in Houston and I am amazed. I don't know what is in this stuff, but it works. Thanks again PetWellbeing&quot; Diane</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial<br /></strong>&ldquo;When the vet told me my cat (Minni) had cancer, I went numb. A good friend had been through a similar situation, so she told me about ES Clear. I am so happy I tried it, because Minni is much more comfortable now. Thanks to ES Clear, I'm feeling optimistic for the first time in months!&rdquo; Andrea, Cold Lake, Alta</p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&ldquo;I have a few words of advice to offer your customers whose cats have been diagnosed with cancer. First, do not give up hope. If you develop a total treatment plan, you can give your cat many more years of healthy, happy life. Second, make sure you include ES Clear as part of the treatment. There&rsquo;s simply no doubt in my mind that it made Hillary (my cat) feel so much better! Thank you, PetWellbeing.&rdquo; Shirley, San Diego CA </p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;I did not want to put my little girl through chemo and radiation, I just wanted her to live the rest of her life as comfortable as she possibly could, since taking ES cancer clear I have noticed that she is so much more lively, playful and happy, which tells me that she is feeling great, and thats all I could ask for.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Steroid drops and other stuff I got from the vet just irritated his ear. Certainly the cancer won't go away, but I believe the products I've gotten from your site have improved his quality of life and slowed the spread of the cancer a little bit. He was diagnosed 3 mos. ago and is still here, I hope for a month or two more, and I believe the 'cancer kit' I bought from your site has helped. His comfort has been better because of it, and I get more time with him. He's the best cat I've ever had, so I appreciate that very much.</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial </strong><br />&quot;Hi, I wanted to take the time to update you on my cat's progress and thank you for making your product available on-line.</p>
    <p>Miss Boomer was diagnosed with Cancer in July 2006 after 2 years of symptoms in which testing was negative, the test and X-ray unfortunately came back positive this time. She has a rare form of cancer with the tumor located inside her nose. I was told she had a very aggressive form of cancer and they could try very aggressive daily radiation treatments for 14 days straight. They told me this would most likely make her sick, cause some hair loss, possibility of blindness since the tumor was so close to the eye. Then they couldn't tell me if treatments might extend her life our not but expected maybe a result of an extra 2-6 months.</p>
    <p>I wasn't sure where to turn so started exploring the internet for alternative options. I talk to my local vet and he didn't think the outcome of the radiation would be positive and had not had any experience with natural remedies but didn't think I had anything to loose by giving it a try.</p>
    <p><img height="139" width="500" src="http://www.petwellbeing.com/images/customers/testimonial_cat_cancer_miss_boomer.jpg" alt="cat cancer testimonial - Picture Miss Boomer" /></p>
    <p>I am very happy to report that Miss Boomer is doing well. I have been amazed and the vet recently was amazed that she was doing so well, yet even that she was alive at this point.</p>
    <p>I did have to take Miss Boomer to the vet recently because her cheek had swelled up practically over night. I was worried it was the tumor, but fortunately the vet thought it was a sinus infection due to the backup of sinuses caused by the blockage of the tumor. She is now on a pretty much steady dose of antibiotics to keep the sinus infection under control.</p>
    <p>Other than that her appetite is fantastic and she plays occasionally (comparable to her pre-cancer state), roams the house and still lets our other cat Curri know who is boss.</p>
    <p><strong>I cannot thank you enough for the availability of your product and for extending Miss Boomer's life.</strong> She is very lovable and affectionate and is only just now 8 years old. I could not give up on her life at only 7 years old and thanks to you have been able to spend more quality time with her than ever imagined possible 9 months ago. The tumor has continued to grow but I am convinced it is at a much slower progression with the ES Clear. And...so wonderful to have it in a liquid form which is so easy to place in her mouth.</p>
    <p>If you have anything that might help with the prevention of the sinus infection and build up with the blockage in her nose, please let me know.&quot;</p>
    <p>Very appreciative customer, <br />Vicki Winchell</p>

    <p><strong>What is Feline Skin Irritation and Disease?</strong></p>
    <p><span>Cat skin disorders are the most common pet ailments. A healthy animal has bright, odorless hair and skin, free of debris, grease and irritation. A cat&rsquo;s skin may be irritated if it has a rash, is dry and/or flaking, greasy, red, swollen or itchy. The causes of cat skin irritation and disease are numerous; these include environmental toxins that can irritate the skin, poor nutrition, mineral or vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid and kidney disorders. During the healing process of cat skin diseases, skin eruptions or irritation are normal and are indicative of the healing process. </span><span>Cat owners should pay close attention to the pet&rsquo;s environment such as his bed or sleeping space which should be examined frequently and cleaned or changed when necessary.

  name: Embark Dog Food
  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:27
  dosage: |-
    <p>Embark has been specially formulated as a standalone food or as a supplement for your homemade dog food.  As any raw dehydrated food is different from the more conventional kibble or even cooked and processed foods, it is important to help your pet successfully make the transition in their diet.</p>
    <p> If your pet is enjoying a raw food diet already, then it works well to rehydrate Embark and mix with the regular diet immediately.  However, for other dogs that are on dry kibbles or canned dog food, then it is usually better to introduce Embark gradually over several days to a week. </p>
    <p> Follow the instructions and mix just a little of the hydrated Embark to the regular dry or canned food on the first day.  Over the course of the next few days, reduce the amount of the dog&rsquo;s normal food while increasing the amount of Embark until you are feeding the old and the new foods at a ratio of 1:1.  At this point, slowly start reducing the amount of the old food and increase the amount of Embark until you are only feeding Embark to your pet. Making the change slowly will help the intestinal flora in the dog&rsquo;s stomach to adapt to the new food easier.</p>
    <p> <strong>Mixing Instructions</strong><br /> All of the Honest Kitchen&rsquo;s raw dehydrated dog foods are measured and mixed in the same way.  For each dry measured cup of Embark, mix 1 to 1 &frac12; cups of warm water (from the tap is fine).  After stirring well, let sit for 5-10 minutes for the mixture to hydrate.  It will resemble oatmeal or a stew when ready to serve &ndash; only brightly colored due to the dehydration process. At this point, you can mix in your pet&rsquo;s choice of vegetables, fruit raw or cooked meats or bones.  Serve right away.  If the dog doesn't finish the serving, be sure to pick up the remainder and refrigerate until the next meal.  Don&rsquo;t reuse the same food after 48 hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Yield Guidelines</strong><br />   If you follow the directions on the box, Embark will give the following yields:</p>
    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>4 oz, which is 1 cup</td>

    <p><strong>Feeding Guidelines</strong><br /> Serve the proper measure of dry Embark, as per the dog's weight, in a bowl with warm water as per the mixing instructions above.  The following daily amounts can be adjusted to suit the variations of breed, age and level of activity as required for each dog.  If the dog weighs:</p>

                <td>2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 50 lbs</td>
                <td>2 Cups</td>

                <td>2 3/4 Cups</td>
                <td>5 1/2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>  These dry measures may not seem like much, but keep in mind that one cup of dry measure mixes to approximately one pound of fresh food.  An additional half to one cup of extra meat or other fresh food can be added to supplement each serving once the dry food has been hydrated.</p>

    <p><strong>Embark is a grain free, low carbohydrate dog food.</strong> This diet was  designed for dogs of all life stages including active adults, puppies,  pregnancy and nursing. It contains higher protein and fat to support muscle structure,  function and body mass.</p>
    <p> Embark is superior in nutrition to commercial dog foods and was designed to be as healthy as raw homemade diets (without the mess or effort of cooking it yourself). Embark was specifically developed for dogs with sensitive stomachs and other chronic ailments that may have resulted from eating grains and gluten.  By removing these ingredients from  a dog's diet, many animals quickly find relief and return to vibrant health.  </p>
    <p> <strong>Embark contains no by-products,</strong> extra salts or sugars, artificial colors or flavors, and no chemical preservatives.  Other common ingredients in commercial kibble dog food that are NOT in Embark include beet pulp, rice, wheat, corn or soy.  The reason for the absence of these 'other' ingredients is that they are considered to be common allergens for dogs.  They can cause problems like dry or itchy skin, lack of energy, ear problems and even hair loss.</p>
    <p><strong>Only the freshest top quality ingredients are used in Embark</strong>, which is then gently dehydrated in such a way as to preserve to the high vitamin, mineral and enzyme levels of the original food. This process is perfectly safe and very healthy.  Meats and eggs are dehydrated slightly differently.  They are dehydrated at high temperatures to kill any bacterial and could be considered 'cooked' by the process.   The finished dry food is healthy, nutritious and even safe for puppies and senior animals.</p>
    <p>Embark is produced in an FDA certified food production facility in California, where  human foods like breakfast cereals and drink mixes are created for people to eat.  As a food production facility, it undergoes regular FDA inspections.</p>
    <p>  Embark can be fed as a standalone diet, as it is nutritionally complete or it can be served with your dog&rsquo;s favorite meat, fruits and vegetables mixed in.</p>
    <p><strong>Reasons to feed your dog Embark</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Nutritional balance
        <ul>
            <li> Embark is a complete food (all natural and wholesome) </li>
            <li>All the ingredients are  of the best quality and freshness</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Convenience
        <ul>
            <li>Raw food is messy and time consuming to prepare</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Grain, gluten and filler free</li>
        <li>Embark is packaged and sold dry and only requires warm water to create a wholesome diet for your pets </li>
    </ul>
    <p> <strong>Embark is a truly delicious product</strong> that is simple to store, easy to hydrate and great to take along on your travels.  Your dog will appreciate the taste even as you appreciate the peace of mind of having purchased such a high quality product.</p>

  description: <p>While other acne medications containing bezoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, or tretinoin have strong antimicrobial activity on Propionibacterium Acnes, these medications cause severe over-drying and irritation of the skin. This causes the body to respond by producing even more oil to combat dryness thereby starting a vicious never ending cycle. Trioxil&reg; is the only acne medication that has antimicrobial activity against Propionibacterium Acnes bacteria while at the same time deeply calming and soothing the skin. In fact, the bisazulene compound (a very strong antimicrobial and antibacterial) is actually derived from chamomile flowers which have soothing and calming properties. Thus Trioxil&reg; treats both of the underlying causes - the bacteria involved in acne pathogenesis and the inflammatory response of acne.</p>

    <p><strong>CANCER means nothing to your dog: he only knows he doesn&rsquo;t feel well.</strong> You can help him feel better. There is no accepted cancer cure but there are treatments proven to stop or decrease generation of cancerous cells (desmutagenic process). Burdock is at the desmutagenic core of ES Clear. This herbs, vitamins and minerals are proven to ease natural cancer symptoms and the side effects caused by traditional treatments. </p>
    <p><strong>Natural, herbal treatment: ES Clear was developed by a naturopathic veterinarian to:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give your dog the best possible chance of beating cancer </li>
        <li>Keep your dog as comfortable and pain-free as possible </li>
    </ul>
    <p>ES Clear can be used as a standalone product or as a supplement to veterinary treatments.</p>
    <p><strong>How will the ingredients in ES Clear help my dog?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Burdock</strong>: treats skin conditions and promotes wound healing, liver cleansing, lowers blood sugar which decreases the incidence of wound necrosis.</p>
    <p><strong>Sheep Sorrel:</strong> eases abnormal swelling including tumors, regenerates healthy cells, and causes detoxification and cleansing.</p>
    <p><strong>Slippery Elm: </strong>creates mucilage that coats your pet&rsquo;s mouth, throat, stomach and intestines. Lessens inflammation upon contact allowing proper swallowing.</p>
    <p><strong>Turkey Rhubarb:</strong> cleanses the digestive system and treats indigestion.</p>
    <p><strong>Vitamins A, B complex, C, K: </strong>aids skin repair and cellular reproduction; decreases homocysteine blood levels; scavenges harmful free radical cells.</p>
    <p><strong>Calcium:</strong> supports bone and muscle health.</p>
    <p><strong>Magnesium:</strong> supports your dog's nervous system.</p>
    <p><strong>Sodium:</strong> helps prevent dehydration.</p>
    <p>Cancer is a unique state when the body&rsquo;s healing system fails to eliminate cells with damaged or altered DNA. These cells regenerate at an uncontrolled rate. The immune system is not eliminating the corrupt cells so outside intervention is needed. Traditional therapies are surgery for masses of cells that form a solid tumor, radiation to ionize localized masses/tumors, and chemotherapy to poison the rapidly growing cancer cells. X-rays or ultrasounds can be used to identify the site and size of solid tumors, or to indicate &quot;shadows&quot; of cancer groups.</p>
    <p>Alternative treatments support traditional treatments and the idea that nutritional/herbal supplements prevent cancer is widely accepted by many veterinarians. Alternative remedies don&rsquo;t have the severe side effects of conventional treatments. </p>
    <p>As with human cancer, the precise causes of dog cancer are not always known. We know it is partly genetic, plus there are contributing factors like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diet (e.g. fatty diet, food additives, etc.) </li>
        <li>Environment (polluted water and air, etc.) </li>
        <li>Advanced age and stress </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these factors can damage your dogs&rsquo;s immune system, weakening his body's natural ability to fight cancerous cells.</p>
    <p><strong>Keep your dog&rsquo;s immune system strong </strong>and you will go a long way to preventing his cancer from spreading to healthy tissues. You&rsquo;ll also keep him happier and more comfortable.</p>
    <p><strong>What is ES Clear for Dog Cancer?</strong></p>
    <p>A proprietary combination of specially-selected herbal extracts, ES Clear has been painstakingly formulated by a leading naturopathic vet.</p>
    <p>The herbs in ES Clear have been used for centuries in traditional medicine. They have been show to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Slow the growth of cancer </li>
        <li>Reduce or prevent the spread of cancer to surrounding cells </li>
        <li>Strengthen a dog&rsquo;s immune system </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Will ES Clear cure my dog&rsquo;s cancer?</strong></p>
    <p>There is no sure-fire cure for cancer, in dogs or in humans. For us to claim that ES Clear will cure your dog&rsquo;s cancer would be irresponsible.</p>
    <p>But we can say two things with confidence: First, the herbs in ES Clear have shown excellent results in treating dog cancer, particularly when used as a part of a comprehensive treatment program. Second, our customers are telling us it works. See just a couple of their testimonials below. </p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong><br />&quot;Hello, I just wanted to let you know that my Chow/Lab cross Stacy is doing much better now that we have started her on ES Clear. </p>
    <p>Stacy has noticeably improved. She has way more energy and her appetite has picked up again. We have decided against taking her in to re-evaluate her tumor growth, but I feel that even if the tumor is not shrinking, she is getting a second chance in her final days.

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />All I can say about the cancer product that I ordered is that it has appeared to put the tumor in remission. </p>
    <p>The tumor is still there but has stopped growing. I took my pet(Dog) to one of the best Veterinarians in the country.(Okla.St.Univ.) and they did confirm what my local vet told me. He was diagnosed with melanoma cancer in the roof of his mouth. Also, He had gotten to the point that he would not eat very much. He is now eating almost normal again even though the tumor still exists. </p>
    <p>He dose not appear to be in any pain now like he appeared to be at first. He even plays around some now quite often. He barks again which he didn't when he was first diagnosed. I really and truly believe that the medication I received from you played a decisive roll in his progress. </p>
    <p>This was the only medication I have used. I was desperate in trying to find something out there at the time because he was given just a very short time to live. As a matter of fact, my local vet gave him only about 1 month before he would have to be put down. I couldn't deal with that. I just knew I had to try to find another answer. It has been about 2 months now since I started him on the medication and like I said &quot;the tumor still exists but it has stopped growing. I hope that eventually it will begin to diminish in size because he does have a little difficulty breathing sometimes especially if he gets too hot. He has been living indoors since he was diagnosed because I wanted to try to keep his stress level down as much as possible from the heat outdoors. Anyone who owns a Rottweiler knows that they are not very tolerant to the heat. He is very well mannered and too my surprise was no problem at all to house-break him. I couldn't ask for a better companion that what he has been over the past 11 years. He is a big dog and sometimes we have to step over him but we don't mind that anymore. We realize that we only have our loving pets for a short time anyway so a little inconvenience now and then doesn't matter now. He is as good as any dog could be in every way. He has never been aggressive to anyone his whole life. He is friendlier to other people than most people are to one another. I know I will have to let him go someday but I just didn't want to lose him the way he was going. </p>
    <p>I had looked frantically for a solution and I found &quot;Petwellbeing&quot; and gave it a try. So, in just these few words I have given you I hope you understand how grateful I am for this product. I believe it has been a life saver for Buster. I know that if he could speak for himself he'd tell you how grateful he is also. We thank you immensely for your help </p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;ES Clear has helped prolong the life of our dog and has made her feel much better.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />Kiki was diagnosed with cancer in May 2007, and we decided against chemotherapy due to her small size and uncertain results that the medication has. It is 10 months later and Kiki is still doing well being on ES clear. I found the product accidentally when I was searching for essaic tea that a friend with cancer is using and thought it was worth a try to give Kiki a little tea. Since the 2 products contain the EXACT ingredients; I purchased the ES clear that was easier to use.</p>

    <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>What is Canine Skin Irritation?</strong><br />Dog skin irritations and disorders are the most common pet ailments. A healthy dog has bright, odorless hair and skin, free of debris, grease and irritation. A dog&rsquo;s skin may be irritated if it has a rash, is dry and/or flaking, greasy, red, or itchy. </p>
    <p>The causes can be numerous from food allergies to fleas and ticks and other irritants. If your dog vomits after a meal, this is an indication that he may have a food allergy. Dog owners should pay close attention to the dog&rsquo;s environment such as its bed or sleeping space which should be cleaned or changed frequently. </p>
    <p>Royal Coat's formula contains fish oil (Omega 3) and borage oil (Omega 6), the combination clinically proven effective in the treatment of canine skin disorders. </p>
    <p>Clinical veterinary research has shown that EPA, DHA, and DHA available from fish oil and borage oil provide rapid relief for excessive shedding, dry skin, constant licking and scratching, eczema and dermatitis. These fatty acids are bio-available immediately for a fast improvement in you dog's coat and skin. </p>

    <p><strong>About cat skin wounds</strong></p>
    <p>Cat skin irritation can be caused by allergies, insect bites, scratches, scrapes or wounds. Cats may excessively scratch the skin causing further irritation. Eventually the hair in the affected area can be torn out and the skin starts to bleed. An inflamed patch of skin may also ooze a clear or yellowish liquid. These are called hot spots, and can occur anywhere on the body. To help treat the wounds, clip the hair in the surrounding area and cleanse the area with a mild soap and water treatment. Then apply Feline Rescue Spray to reduce pain, decrease healing time and prevent infection. Other recommended preventative measures include covering the affected area and clipping your pet&rsquo;s nails to minimize the ill affects of scratching.</p>

  subtitle_brand: "<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">100% natural dehydrated food for dogs</span>"
  name: Keen Dog Food
  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:27
  dosage: |-
    <p>Keen, although designed as a high quality low cost food, has not compromised in any way to the quality of the food used.  It is still a standalone formula or can be used to supplement any homemade food diets that your pet currently enjoys. If raw dehydrated food is a different form of food than the one your beloved companion currently enjoys, then it is important to help your pet successfully make the switch to this new type of food.</p>
    <p>If your pet is already on a raw food diet, then hydrate Keen and just mix the new food into the dog&rsquo;s normal food.  For other pets that are on commercial dry kibbles or canned dog foot, then it is better to take several days to a week to help them make the switch.</p>
    <p>Start with mixing a little bit of hydrated Keen with the regular dry or canned food.  On the next meal, add a little more.  Keep doing this until you are feeding equal parts of both kinds of food.  Then slowly increase the amount of Keen and decrease the amount of the commercial food.  By making the transition slow, your dog's intestinal flora will adapt in a much better way and the dog will be able to digest food more easily. Once you are feeding straight Keen, then we suggests that you add up to a &frac12; cup of the dog's favorite meat, vegetable or fruit to the mixture. </p>
    <p><strong>Mixing Instructions</strong><br /> For each dry measured cup of Keen, mix 1 to 1 &frac12; cups of warm water.  After stirring well, let sit for 5 - 10 minutes for the mixture to hydrate.  It will resemble oatmeal or a stew when ready to serve. At this point, you can mix in your pet's favorite foods.  Serve right away.  If the dog doesn't finish the serving, be sure to pick up the remainder and refrigerate until the next meal.  If there is any food remaining after 48 hours, discard.</p>
    <p><strong>Yield Guidelines</strong><br /> When mixed properly, the following yields should be seen:</p>

    <p><strong>The Complete Solution to Fighting Hair Loss and Promoting Hair Regrowth</strong></p>
    <p>Hair loss and thinning hair have been sensitive issues for both men and women throughout time. Recently, medical science has identified the main cause of hair loss. It is now a known medical fact that hair loss stems from both genetic and hormonal causes.</p>
    <p>In the vast majority of cases, hair loss &ndash; in both men and women &ndash; is caused by a hormonal byproduct called DHT (dihydrotestostrone). Under the suppressive effects of DHT, the hair follicles become thinner and finer until the hair is permanently lost.</p>
    <p><strong>What treatments are available to fight hair loss?</strong></p>
    <p>Chemical Treaments</p>
    <p>Propecia&reg; is a FDA approved synthetic medication available only to men by prescription. It works by reducing DHT levels, however, Propecia&reg; although effective, may be associated with a wide range of side effects (including impotence) and cannot be used by women.</p>
    <p>Natural treatments</p>
    <p>Revivogen is a natural topical formula, which works through the same mechanism as Propecia&reg;. Revivogen is made with natural ingredients that have been scientifically proven to reduce DHT production. In fact, the active ingredients in Revivogen reduce DHT even more effectively than Propecia&reg;. In addition these ingredients prevent DHT's attachment to the hair follicle, which is not done by Propecia&reg;.</p>
    <p>By reducing DHT's production and its destructive effects on the hair follicle, the weakened and miniaturized hairs become thicker and stronger again, leading to a fuller and healthier head of hair. By targeting the cause of hair loss at the molecular level, Revivogen's powerful natural ingredients revitalize and protect the hair, blocking the androgen receptor and stimulating hair growth.</p>

    <p><strong>Indications and Usage</strong></p>
    <p>Revivogen Scalp Therapy Formula</p>
    <p>The main active ingredients in this Revivogen formula have been scientifically proven to reduce the production of DHT by blocking the activity of the enzyme, 5 alpha reductase. This enzyme converts testosterone to DHT and is present in the hair follicles and scalp at high levels. Other ingredients block the androgen receptors and stimulate hair growth.</p>
    <p>By blocking the activity of the 5 alpha reductase and lowering the concentration of DHT in the scalp, Revivogen helps to revitalize and protect the hair follicle. This is a topical formula, which ensures the concentration of the active ingredients at the hair follicle where DHT is produced without the systemic side effects.</p>
    <p>Revivogen Bio-Cleansing Shampoo</p>
    <p>The shampoo contains the main active ingredients found in the topical formula and complements its activity, but is not effective by itself. The Bio-Cleansing Shampoo gently cleanses the scalp and removes sebum and DHT from the scalp. Important bio-active nutrients nourish, moisturize and improve the hair and scalp condition, creating a healthy environment for hair growth.</p>
    <p>Revivogen Hair-Thickening Conditioner</p>
    <p>The conditioner, when used in conjunction with Revivogen Shampoo and Natural Scalp Therapy, is proven to thicken and protect new hair growth. This conditioner will leave your hair feeling soft and touchable.</p>
    <p><strong>Track record</strong></p>
    <p>Within six to eight weeks of using Revivogen you can expect a significant decrease in hair loss and appreciate a difference in how your hair looks and feels. With continued use, the hair quality will continue to improve and stay healthy with best results occurring after twelve to eighteen months. Once the desired results are achieved, continued use of Revivogen is needed to maintain the revitalized hair. </p>

    <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>What is Feline Skin Irritation?</strong><br />Cat skin irritations and disorders are the most common pet ailments. A healthy cat has bright, odorless hair and skin, free of debris, grease and irritation. A cat&rsquo;s skin may be irritated if it has a rash, is dry and/or flaking, greasy, red, or itchy. </p>

    <p><strong>About dog skin wounds</strong><br />Minor wounds and skin irritations on dogs may have many sources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allergies </li>
        <li>Insect Bites </li>
        <li>Scratches, scrapes and minor cuts </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Often, dogs can&rsquo;t resist scratching or biting at these areas, making the problem much worse. Dogs can scratch until their hair falls out and their skin is bleeding. </p>
    <p>Commonly, an affected area of your dog&rsquo;s skin may start oozing a yellow or clear fluid. These patches are known as hot spots.</p>
    <p>How to treat hot spots, minor wounds and other skin irritations on dogs</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim your dog&rsquo;s hair in area surrounding the wound/hot spot. </li>
        <li>With soap and water, cleanse the affected area. </li>
        <li>Apply Canine Rescue Spray. </li>
        <li>If practical, cover the affected area. </li>
        <li>Consider clipping your dog&rsquo;s nails (to reduce the effects of scratching). </li>

    <p>Hair growth inhibitors: gel 2oz plastic bottle with pump. For topical hair growth inhibition used daily. Not for ophthalmic, oral or intravaginal use.</p>
    <p>Hair No More hair inhibiting gel is indicated for the prevention of the regrowth of unwanted body and facial hair in both men and women. Hair No More hair inhibiting gel has been studied on body and facial areas and found to be effective on all individuals over a 1 to 4 month period to reach maintenance for most body hairs. 95% of individuals studied showed complete stoppage of hair growth when maintenance is reached. Usage on body areas have produced no known side effects and may be used on sensitive individuals.</p>
    <p>This product does not enter the blood stream. All FDA approved ingredients.</p>
    <p><strong>Clinical Pharmacology</strong></p>
    <p>There are approximately seven years of studies confirming the hair inhibiting effects exhibited by the bio-enzymatic plant enzymes that work at the follicle site to inhibit the regrowth of hair. Combined plant enzymes appear to work on every aspect of the hair shaft and surrounding double helix sulfa bond. Two of the botanicals work on the keratin; one unwinds the tightly wound keratin while the other breaks apart the cell structure inside the hair shaft. The exterior of the hair shaft which is composed of cystine is worked on by a third botanical. The fourth botanical works directly on the sulfa bond to reduce it, thereby eliminating cystine to cystine growth spurts which occur only in the presence of its catalyst, the double helix sulfa bond at the follicle site. The effect thereby eliminates the regrowth of hair, prevents ingrown hair and smoothes out razor bumps.</p>
    <p><strong>Clinical Trials</strong></p>
    <p>Results of topical dermal studies for contact sensitization and photocontact reveal that daily use of Hair No More hair inhibiting gel is not expected to cause any known side effects. Seven years of clinical trials have demonstrated no such reactions in susceptible individuals unless the hair inhibiting spray is applied immediately to already irritated skin cause by shaving too closely, improper use of depilatories which irritate the skin or other skin irritants which may have been applied prior to using Hair No More hair inhibiting gel, i.e. acne abrasion and chemical peels.</p>
    <p>For best results, prior complete hair removal down to the follicle site is recommended either through waxing, sugaring, or use of Hair No More hair removal cream, as the hair inhibiting works mainly at the follicle site. Shaving or other depilatories may be used to remove the hair but results will take longer to achieve because there is still hair in the pore, partially blocking the hair inhibitor from immediately reaching the follicle site.</p>
    <p>In some cases a hair shaft may be so thick that it precludes gel or spray hair retardant from reaching the follicle site in which case the hair must be removed completely using Hair No More hair removal cream, waxing, sugaring, electrolysis, or laser surgery. In rare cases, tensile strength of hair fiber may be so great as to prevent hair removal cream from working during its required time and patient must resort to other means of hair removal for the next 3 to 6 weeks with daily applications of hair removal spray to reduce the volume and tensile strength of the hair shaft. Applying the removal cream afterward should then remove the hair down to the follicle site.</p>
    <p>The advantages of Hair No More hair inhibitors over other inhibitors are (1) can be used anywhere on the skin and prevents regrowth without skin reactions, (2) prevents ingrown hairs, (3) leaves the skin baby soft and smooth and protected from the environment. The fragrance green tea, a natural antioxidant in its pure form, has clinically been proven to protect the skin from environmental damage 100% greater than the available vitamin C creams.</p>

Make sure that your hand and the strip is as \r\n        close and parallel to the skin as possible. <br>\r\n        Continue using the same strip by folding the strip in half and massaging with \r\n        your fingers, unfold and keep using until it is full of hair. </P>\r\n      <P><FONT color=\"006666\"><STRONG>For best results (technique)</STRONG></FONT><BR>\r\n        Ensure the skin is dry before applying the gel. The hair growth should be \r\n        at least 1/8 of an inch or 3 mm. Apply a thin layer of gel evenly in the direction \r\n        of hair growth. When placing the cotton reusable strip over the gel-coated \r\n        area, leave a small space at the end of the strip for pulling. Before pulling, \r\n        apply firm pressure on the strip while rubbing in a quick up and down motion. \r\n        Do not lift the cotton strip out or away, but pull parallel to the skin in \r\n        a swift motion. Always pull the strip in the opposite direction of hair growth. \r\n        Hold the skin firmly with one hand before pulling to ease the hair removing \r\n        process. You may reuse the same gel coated cotton strip over the same/other \r\n        areas until gel is fully used. Applying the gel, placing of cotton strip and \r\n        pulling it back technique is important. If done properly you will eliminate \r\n        any pain that might be associated in the process. Many people find less pain \r\n        using sugaring gel because sugaring gel tends to stick to the hair and not \r\n        the skin unlike waxing. You will experience virtually no pain with its repeated \r\n        use.

    <p>Bill Lawler, M.D., a cosmetic surgeon with a 26 year history in aesthetics, witnessed the evolution of nearly all skin care products. &quot;Viterol.A does something completely different than other creams. While Botox is still the treatment of choice for deep furrows and certain types of wrinkles, Viterol.A is the most effective topical treatment for fine lines that I have encountered in my practice. There is also a clearly visible improvement in skin smoothness and firmness,&quot; he said.</p>
    <p>You have already seen hundreds of claims from a plethora of skin care manufacturers who pedal seemingly miraculous cures in all types of creams, lotions, and serums and yet more likely then not you were disappointed with the results. So why should you trust our claims about Viterol.A? First, Viterol.A is clinically proven as a successful treatment for the signs of aging. Second, DS Laboratories (the manufacturer of Viterol.A) is so confident that you will see an improvement in the condition of your skin, that you can return the unused portion of Viterol.A and get a full refund! How many other manufacturers offer this kind of guarantee?</p>

    <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>What causes dog&rsquo;s bad breath?</strong><br />Dogs, like people, are subject to plaque build-up on their teeth. Of course, the situation with dogs is even worse as few of them brush their teeth twice a day! When you also consider that rarely are leafy greens the backbone of a dog&rsquo;s diet, it&rsquo;s really not surprising that dogs suffer from bad breath. </p>
    <p>Other dental problems are also common in dogs: periodontal disease, tooth decay, bacterial infections, etc. Is it any wonder dogs sometimes get bad breath?</p>
    <p>All dogs have some degree of breath odor. In itself, a dog&rsquo;s bad breath is no big deal. But what causes a dog&rsquo;s bad breath can definitely be a big deal: Particularly bad breath may be a sign that bacteria and other toxins are destroying your dog&rsquo;s teeth and gums. </p>
    <p>Even worse, the effects of dental diseases are not just confined to your dog&rsquo;s mouth. Its effects are felt throughout your dog&rsquo;s body. Periodontal diseases can actually shorten your dog&rsquo;s life, and should be treated.</p>

    <p>Hair No More hair inhibiting spray stops regrowth of unwanted body and facial hair in both men and women. It has been studied on body and facial areas and found to be effective on all individuals over a 1 to 4 month period to reach maintenance for most body hairs.</p>
    <p><strong>95% of users studied showed complete stoppage of hair growth when maintenance is reached.</strong> Usage on body areas have produced no known side effects and may be used on sensitive individuals.</p>
    <p>This product does not enter the blood stream. All FDA approved ingredients.</p>
    <p><strong>Clinical Pharmacology</strong></p>
    <p>There are approximately seven years of studies confirming the hair inhibiting effects exhibited by the bio-enzymatic plant enzymes that work at the follicle site to inhibit the regrowth of hair. Combined plant enzymes appear to work on every aspect of the hair shaft and surrounding double helix sulfa bond. Two of the botanicals work on the keratin; one unwinds the tightly wound keratin while the other breaks apart the cell structure inside the hair shaft. The exterior of the hair shaft which is composed of cystine is worked on by a third botanical. The fourth botanical works directly on the sulfa bond to reduce it, thereby eliminating cystine to cystine growth spurts which occur only in the presence of its catalyst, the double helix sulfa bond at the follicle site. The effect thereby eliminates the regrowth of hair, prevents ingrown hair and smoothes out razor bumps.</p>
    <p><strong>Clinical Trials</strong></p>
    <p>Results of topical dermal studies for contact sensitization and photocontact reveal that daily use of Hair No More hair inhibiting spray is not expected to cause any known side effects. Seven years of clinical trials have demonstrated no such reactions in susceptible individuals unless the hair inhibiting spray is applied immediately to already irritated skin cause by shaving too closely, improper use of depilatories which irritate the skin or other skin irritants which may have been applied prior to using Hair No More hair inhibiting spray, i.e. acne abrasion and chemical peels.</p>
    <p>For best results, prior complete hair removal down to the follicle site is recommended either through waxing, sugaring, or use of Hair No More hair removal cream, as the hair inhibiting works mainly at the follicle site. Shaving or other depilatories may be used to remove the hair but results will take longer to achieve because there is still hair in the pore, partially blocking the hair inhibitor from immediately reaching the follicle site.</p>
    <p>In some cases a hair shaft may be so thick that it precludes gel or spray hair retardant from reaching the follicle site. In this case the hair must be removed completely using Hair No More hair removal cream, waxing, sugaring, electrolysis, or laser surgery. In rare cases, tensile strength of hair fiber may be so great as to prevent hair removal cream from working during its required time and patient must resort to other means of hair removal for the next 3 to 6 weeks with daily applications of hair inhibitor spray to reduce the volume and tensile strength of the hair shaft. Applying the hair removal cream afterward should then remove the hair down to the follicle site.</p>
    <p>The advantages of Hair No More hair inhibitors over other inhibitors are (1) can be used anywhere on the skin and prevents regrowth without skin reactions, (2) prevents ingrown hairs, (3) leaves the skin baby soft and smooth and protected from the environment. The fragrance green tea, a natural antioxidant in its pure form, has clinically been proven to protect the skin from environmental damage 100% greater than the available vitamin C creams.</p>

  name: Parissa Wax Strips for Body Waxing
  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:29
  dosage: |-
    <p><strong>Areas of Use:</strong></p>
    <p>Legs, Bikini line, Torso, Underarm, Eyebrow, Upper lip, Middle brow, and Jaw line</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not clean skin before using wax strips. </li>
        <li>Take a double strip, soften by rubbing it between your hands, then separate slowly into 2 strips. </li>
        <li>Use large strips for legs and body, small strips for face and bikini line. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>For best results, wait until hair is ~1/4&quot; (1/2cm) long, as shaved hair tends to be strong and resistant. </li>
        <li>Smooth the strip in the direction of hair growth. Strip off in the opposite direction. </li>
        <li>Pull the strip back along itself in one quick movement. The faster the strip is removed, the better the results. </li>
        <li>Smooth down sticky side of strip firmly into skin in direction of hair growth. Hold skin taut below strip with one hand. Use other to grasp lower end of strip and quickly tug in opposite direction of hair growth, keep strip/hand as close and parallel to the skin as possible. Repeat. </li>
        <li>Note: Strips can be used more than once. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For Legs</strong>: Smooth down sticky side of strip firmly onto skin in direction of hair growth. Zip off - hold skin taut below strip with one hand. Use other to grasp lower end of strip &amp; quickly tug in opposite direction of hair growth, keeping strip/hand as close &amp; parallel to the skin as possible. Hint: the faster the strip is removed, the better the result.</p>
    <p><strong>For bikini line</strong>: Trim bikini hair to &frac12;&quot; (1cm) with scissors. Area is sensitive so use small strips. Bend leg outward, stretch skin with one hand and strip off with other against hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>For underarm</strong>: Apply talc sparingly if perspiring. Place arm behind head as far back as possible to tauten skin. Check direction of hair growth as it varies widely. Work on upper and lower half of underarm separately.</p>
    <p><strong>Upper lip</strong>: Keep lips taut over teeth. Work on only &frac12; of lip at a time. Smooth on strip from center to corner and zip off towards your nose. Keep skin taut while stripping off, then apply pressure to the area to minimize discomfort. Soothe and cool areas with ice cube.</p>
    <p>After care: Apply azulene oil to soothe and clean skin. Repeat daily to retain smoothness and suppleness, inhibit regrowth, prevent ingrown hair and boost skin cell regeneration. </p>

          <P><font color="006666"><strong>Description<br>
            </strong></font>Skin disorders are the most common pet ailments. The skin 
            is an important protective barrier for the body, and is responsible for 
            regulating temperature, producing pigment and vitamin D, eliminating toxins 
            and maintaining internal balance (homeostasis). A healthy animal has bright, 
            odorless hair and skin, free of debris, grease and irritation. Because 
            the skin has full contact with the environment, it is continuously exposed 
            to toxins in the form of pollutants, chemical products and infectious 
            agents. Poor nutrition, mineral and vitamin deficiencies, thyroid and 
            kidney disorders may also manifest via the skin. During the healing process 
            of skin diseases, skin eruptions or irritation may occur; this is normal 
            and is indicative of the cleaning process. Because so many different problems 
            are reflected by skin disorders, owners must pay close attention to the 
            dog's environment. The hair and skin surface must be carefully examined 
            for skin rash. The dog's living space (mattress, covers) should also be 
            examined, cleaned or changed if necessary. Herbs will be helpful in treating 
            conditions and improving nutrition and immune system.

    <p>Does your face become dry, itchy, irritated, or flaky shortly after cleansing? Or maybe oil starts to break through about an hour later?</p>
    <p>Do you have large pores and blackheads?<br />Is your skin dull, uneven, or blotchy?<br />Is your skin dry and oily at the same time? Are you starting to develop wrinkles but still have acne breakouts?<br />In short, is your skin simply driving you crazy?</p>
    <p>If you thought that a cleanser is nothing more then a way to wash off dirt, oil, and residue of your face, then you are absolutely right. At least right for the vast majority of cleansers on the market or cleansers you may have tried before. And because of that, you may not be totally prepared for what Hydroviton CR&reg; can do for you - it doesn't just clean your skin, it completely transforms your skin. The results are absolutely startling; after just one use the skin looks healthier, smoother, more consistent, with a dramatically improved texture. Developed for oily and acne prone skin this cleanser has also proved remarkable for all skin types; due to its intensely moisturizing and calming properties Hydroviton CR can be used on the most sensitive skin without any irritation. No matter what your skin type, this cleanser will work miracles on your face.</p>
    <p>When most people get an acne outbreak, they usually purchase a harsh cleanser at the local pharmacy containing either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. This is a major mistake! These over the counter products generally dry the skin to reduce oil and remove bacteria, however, harsh over drying of the skin will cause the body to respond by producing even more oil to combat dryness, creating a vicious cycle. This will often lead to more acne or other skin problems.</p>
    <p>Hydroviton CR medicated cleanser contains organic micro-spheres that penetrate to the deepest layers of the skin to deeply moisturize, while at the same time removing toxins, bacteria, and regulating sebum production. It is the ideal cleanser for acne sufferers that provides immediate results.</p>
    <p>If you have a mild case of acne, washing your face with Hydroviton CR just once a day is often enough to completely eliminate acne without any additional treatment. The added benefit is that the skin also becomes smoother, shine free, balanced, and healthier.</p>

    <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>What causes dog&rsquo;s bad breath?</strong><br />Dogs, like people, are subject to plaque build-up on their teeth. Of course, the situation with dogs is even worse as few of them brush their teeth twice a day! When you also consider that rarely are leafy greens the backbone of a dog&rsquo;s diet, it&rsquo;s really not surprising that dogs suffer from bad breath. </p>
    <p>Other dental problems are also common in dogs: periodontal disease, tooth decay, bacterial infections, etc. Is it any wonder dogs sometimes get bad breath?</p>
    <p>All dogs have some degree of breath odor. In itself, a dog&rsquo;s bad breath is no big deal. But what causes a dog&rsquo;s bad breath can definitely be a big deal: Particularly bad breath may be a sign that bacteria and other toxins are destroying your dog&rsquo;s teeth and gums. </p>
    <p>Even worse, the effects of dental diseases are not just confined to your dog&rsquo;s mouth. Its effects are felt throughout your dog&rsquo;s body. Periodontal diseases can actually shorten your dog&rsquo;s life, and should be treated.</p>

    What are Dog Allergies? <br />Every allergy that troubles humans has its counterpart in dogs. This includes allergic reactions to chemicals and drugs, contact dermatitis, insect bites and food allergies. An especially common problem in dogs is an allergy to flea bites.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Common Symptoms of Allergies in Dogs</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hot spots or eruptions on your dog's skin </li>
        <li>Anal itching </li>
        <li>Itching and inflamed toes or ears </li>
        <li>Digestive problems, including gas or diarrhea </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dog allergies may be caused by a number of factors including poor diet and changes in your dog's lifestyle (including environment and food). When a dog has an allergy, his body develops and abnormal reaction to substances. Different dogs may react very differently, even if they&rsquo;re allergic to the same thing.</p>
    <p>Often, the &quot;substance&quot; a dog is allergic to is in its own body. The dog's body then reacts against itself, just like in the case of an auto-immune disease.</p>
    <p>It's often tricky to determine exactly what a dog is allergic to. But it's important to make the effort, as much discomfort can often be avoided simply by ensuring your dog isn't exposed to the allergen.</p>
    <p>Herbal relief, such as Canine Stimmune, is also very helpful in treating the symptoms dog allergies. It goes a long way to relieving your friend of the intense discomfort caused by dog allergies. It's also great for boosting his immune system. </p>

    <p>Serving Size: 3 Capsules<br />Servings Per Container: 40<br /><br />   <strong>Glucosamine Sulfate</strong> - 1000mg<br /> This is a naturally occurring substance in the body that has been widely recognized as useful in the fight against arthritis. It is an anti-inflammatory that provides pain relief for users. It has also been shown in a number of independent studies to be very useful in cases of degenerative joint disease. It can help to slow the breakdown of joint cartilage and speed up the repair and renewal of damaged cartilage in people with osteoarthritis.</p>
    <p><strong>Chondroitin Sulfate</strong> - 500mg<br /> Another substance that occurs naturally in the body, Chondroitin Sulphate works synergistically with Glucosamine. It neutralizes destructive enzymes in the joints and improves the quality of the body&rsquo;s synovial fluid &ndash; the liquid that reduces friction between the joints during movement.</p>
    <p><strong>Methylsulfonulmethane</strong> (MSM) - 500mg<br /> Found in certain plants, this is an excellent source of sulfur. Research has shown that it&rsquo;s also a natural anti-inflammatory. It has further proven its worth in a number of studies that showed it is helpful in relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis. In one recent study, patients with arthritis who took MSM saw reduced pain and improved physical functioning. It created no major adverse events.</p>
    <p><strong>Bromelain</strong> (from pineapple) - 120GDU<br /> First introduced as a therapeutic supplement over fifty years ago, bromelain extracted from the stem of the pineapple, A natural anti-inflammatory, it works by blocking metabolites that accelerate inflammation. It is widely used to treat sports injuries, trauma, and arthritis.</p>
    <p><strong>Boswellia Extract</strong> (leaf) 65% total - 100mg<br /> This herb has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. It contains anti-inflammatory triterpenoids called boswellic acids. These have been shown to inhibit proinflammatory 5-lipoxygenase chemicals and block leukotriene synthesis. The result is reduced inflammation. Four different triterpene acids are carefully standardized in this formulation.</p>
    <p> <strong>Organic acids</strong> (including Boswellic Acids)<br /> Recent studies have revealed that there is a very positive synergistic effect when combining boswellic acid mixture (BA) and glucosamine for anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic treatment. Glucosamine&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory capabilities are increased when the two supplements are administered together.<br /><br />Other ingredients: Gelatin, silicon dioxide, cellulose, magnesium stearate<br />Allergen Information:&nbsp; Contains shellfish (shrimp, crab) ingredients <br />Contains no milk, egg, tree nut, wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors or preservatives</p>

    <p><strong>Areas of Use:</strong></p>
    <p>Face, underarm, upper-lip and bikini line.</p>
    <p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
    <p>Do not clean skin before using wax strips. Take a double strip, soften by rubbing it between your hands, then separate slowly into 2 strips. Always check direction of hair growth before beginning. Proceed confidently.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 week rule: previously shaved hair is strong and resistant. Wait 2 weeks or until hair is ~1/4&quot; (1/2cm) long before first use. </li>
        <li>Always smooth on in direction of hair growth. Strip off in opposite direction. </li>
        <li>Always pull strip back along itself in one quick movement. Don't peel or pull off slowly. </li>
        <li>The faster the strip is removed the better the results. </li>
        <li>Do not apply the strip more than once on the same area during any given treatment. </li>
        <li>Clean any excess wax remaining on the skin with azulene oil or any other type of oil (mineral, baby or vegetable). </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For bikini line</strong>: Trim bikini hair to &frac12;&quot; (1cm) with scissors. Area is sensitive so use small strips. Bend leg outward, stretch skin with one hand and strip off with other against hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>For underarm</strong>: Apply talc sparingly if perspiring. Place arm behind head as far back as possible to tauten skin. Check direction of hair growth as it varies widely. Work on upper and lower half of underarm separately.</p>
    <p><strong>Upper lip</strong>: Keep lips taut over teeth. Work on only &frac12; of area at a time. Smooth on strip from center to corner and zip off towards your nose. Keep skin taut while stripping off, then apply pressure to the area to minimize discomfort. Soothe and cool areas with ice cube.</p>
    <p><strong>After care</strong>: Apply azulene oil to soothe and clean skin. Repeat daily to retain smoothness and suppleness, inhibit regrowth, prevent ingrown hair and boost skin cell regeneration. Do not use deodorants or antiperspirants for 24 hrs after underarm application.</p>

    <p><strong><span>What are Cat Allergies?</span></strong></p>
    <p>Allergies are the most common illnesses affecting cats. They are caused by changed lifestyles, including food and environment. Cat allergies are characterized by the body's abnormal reaction to internal or external stimuli and are caused by many different factors. Allergic reactions can be different from one cat to another, even for the same allergen (agent). Sometimes, these allergens are in the cat&rsquo;s own body, causing the body to react against itself such as in auto-immune diseases. It is important to try to find the cause for cat allergies, even though it can be difficult. Along with working towards finding the cause, the use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms, and also to strengthen the immune system.</p>

    <p><strong>Hair Loss / Hair Regrowth Treatment Fights DHT</strong></p>
    <p>Hair loss and thinning hair have been sensitive issues for both men and women throughout time. Recently, medical science has identified the main cause of hair loss. It is now a known medical fact that hair loss stems from both genetic and hormonal causes.</p>
    <p>In the vast majority of cases, hair loss &ndash; in both men and women &ndash; is caused by a hormonal byproduct called DHT (dihydrotestostrone). Under the suppressive effects of DHT, the hair follicles become thinner and finer until the hair is permanently lost.</p>
    <p><strong>What treatments are available to fight hair loss?</strong></p>
    <p>Chemical Treaments</p>
    <p>Propecia&reg; is a FDA approved synthetic medication available only to men by prescription. It works by reducing DHT levels, however, Propecia&reg; although effective, may be associated with a wide range of side effects (including impotence) and cannot be used by women.</p>
    <p>Natural treatments</p>
    <p>Revivogen is a natural topical formula, which works through the same mechanism as Propecia&reg;. Revivogen is made with natural ingredients that have been scientifically proven to reduce DHT production. In fact, the active ingredients in Revivogen reduce DHT even more effectively than Propecia&reg;. In addition these ingredients prevent DHT's attachment to the hair follicle, which is not done by Propecia&reg;.</p>
    <p>By reducing DHT's production and its destructive effects on the hair follicle, the weakened and miniaturized hairs become thicker and stronger again, leading to a fuller and healthier head of hair. By targeting the cause of hair loss at the molecular level, Revivogen's powerful natural ingredients revitalize and protect the hair, blocking the androgen receptor and stimulating hair growth.</p>

    <p><strong>Indications and Usage</strong></p>
    <p>The main active ingredients in this Revivogen formula have been scientifically proven to reduce the production of DHT by blocking the activity of the enzyme, 5 alpha reductase. This enzyme converts testosterone to DHT and is present in the hair follicles and scalp at high levels. Other ingredients block the androgen receptors and stimulate hair growth.</p>
    <p>By blocking the activity of the 5 alpha reductase and lowering the concentration of DHT in the scalp, Revivogen helps to revitalize and protect the hair follicle. This is a topical formula, which ensures the concentration of the active ingredients at the hair follicle where DHT is produced without the systemic side effects.</p>
    <p><strong>Track record</strong></p>
    <p>Within six to eight weeks of using Revivogen you can expect a significant decrease in hair loss and appreciate a difference in how your hair looks and feels. With continued use, the hair quality will continue to improve and stay healthy with best results occurring after twelve to eighteen months. Once the desired results are achieved, continued use of Revivogen is needed to maintain the revitalized hair.</p>

  subtitle_brand: <strong>For removal of coarse or stubborn hair.</strong>
  name: Parissa Studio Warm Wax for Coarse Hair
  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:29
  dosage: |-
    <p>Heat warm wax to a liquid consistency and retain at that consistency throughout process for safe and optimal results.</p>
    <p>Microwave: Remove cap and seal. Place on a dish in center of unit and heat on High for 1 to 2 minutes. As microwaves vary, always determine proper heating time for your unit. Do not handle jar, as jar and contents may be extremely hot. Always test temperature of wax before use.</p>
    <p>Do not clean skin before using warm wax. Remember wax does not wash off. Use Azulene Oil to remove wax residue from body. Keep wax away from carpets and furniture. To remove wax from floors, counters etc., use oil, acetone or Fantastic.</p>
    <p>Always check direction of hair growth before beginning. Proceed confidently.</p>
    <p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 week rule &ndash; previously shaved hair is strong and resistant. Wait 1 week or until hair is 1/8&quot; (1/4cm) long before first use. </li>
        <li>For cleanliness always wipe one side of the spatula against lip of jar when retrieving the wax. </li>
        <li>Less is best &ndash; the thinner you spread the wax the better the results. </li>
        <li>Always smooth on in direction of hair growth. Strip off in opposite direction. </li>
        <li>Always pull strip back along itself in one quick movement. Don't peel or pull off slowly. </li>
        <li>The faster the strip is removed the better the results. </li>
        <li>Continually reheat warm wax throughout process to maintain fluid consistency. </li>
        <li>Avoid all interruptions and delays during treatment. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For Legs</strong>: Using edge of spatula, spread paper-thin layer of warm wax in direction of hair growth. Immediately, smooth down strip over waxed area, leaving end of strip extended beyond wax. Rub strip to adhere well. Hold skin taut below strip with one hand. Use other to grasp lower end of strip and tug quickly in opposite direction of hair growth, keeping strip/hand as close and parallel to the skin as possible. The faster the strip is removed, the better the result. Repeat.</p>
    <p>Hint: The same strip can be used several times. With experience, you'll be able to cover large areas and remove it all with one strip in quick, successive motions.</p>
    <p><strong>For bikini line</strong>: Trim bikini hair to 1/2&quot;(1cm) with scissors. Area is sensitive so work in small patches and apply product evenly and thinly. Bend leg outward, stretch skin with one hand and strip off with other against hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>For underarm</strong>: Apply talc sparing. Place arm behind head as far back as possible to tauten skin. Check direction of hair growth as it varies widely. Work on upper and lower half of underarm separately.</p>
    <p><strong>Upper lip</strong>: Keep lip taut over teeth. Work on only &frac12; of area at a time, spreading wax evenly and thinly from center to outer corner. Unevenness and thickness will cause discomfort. Keep skin taut while striping off, then apply pressure to the area to minimize discomfort. Soothe and cool area with ice cube.</p>
    <p><strong>After care</strong>: When finished, remove excess wax and residue with Azulene oil to soothe and clean skin. Repeat daily to retain smoothness and suppleness, inhibit regrowth, prevent ingrown hair and boost skin cell regeneration. Larger bottle of Parissa Azulene Oil sold separately. Discard used strips. Clean spills with oil, acetone or Fantastic.</p>

    <p><strong><span>What is Cat Hypothyroidism?</span></strong></p>
    <p><span>The thyroid is a gland in the neck which regulates body growth and metabolism. Cat hypothyroidism is a condition of lowered thyroid function which can be caused by a problem in the thyroid itself or by raised blood calcium levels. Feline Thyro-up is an herbal tonic that stimulates the cat&rsquo;s thyroid gland and improves metabolism. Its ingredients provide a rich source of iodine which acts as a stimulant to the thyroid and helps to balance hormones and maintain a steady body temperature. </span></p>

  name: Hair No More&#8482; Complete Hair Removal Kit
  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:28
  dosage: |-
    <p><strong>Step One: Hair No More Hair Removal Cream </strong></p>
    <p>Apply a thick layer of the hair removal cream to area of hair removal. Let it stay in place 5-7 minutes or time prescribed by patch testing the area. Cream can be left on up to 15 minutes if tolerable, or test minute to minute on sensitive areas.</p>
    <p>Rinse off using a soft towel or loofah sponge. Rinse with water only &ndash; do not use soap. Do allow product to dry on skin. Removing the hair removal cream from the skin surface due to irritation does not discourage the active ingredients from accomplishing their task at the follicle bulb.</p>
    <p>The cream can be applied again after 24 hours. Use cream when stubble begins to appear. Results will improve if the skin is first exfoliated with a loofah sponge or similar product.</p>
    <p><strong>Step Two: Hair No More hair inhibiting spray and gel</strong></p>
    <p>Apply these products after hair removal.</p>
    <p>Hair No More hair inhibiting <strong>spray</strong> is a concentrated product. One spray across the chest is enough to do half a chest.</p>
    <p>Hair No More hair inhibiting <strong>gel</strong> is also highly concentrated. For an average person, one drop is enough to cover the entire arm from fingertips to elbow.</p>
    <p>Both products are absorbed immediately into the skin leaving it soft and supple without tackiness, requiring only a few seconds to be totally absorbed.</p>
    <p>Use twice a day for the first week, and once a day thereafter. Do not remove or rinse off the skin. You may use other moisturizers or skin conditioners after using Hair No More hair inhibiting gel and spray, but do not use anything else before. (Other products may block the pores, keeping the hair inhibitors from doing their job.)</p>

    <p>Hair Removal Cream</p>
    <p>Discontinue use temporarily if tingling or burning sensations occurs. The tingling of the skin is nature's indication that toleration, for the time frame, has been reached. If necessary, complete the hair removal process in 24 hours or sooner, if skin is clear and no irritation has occurred. Flush skin thoroughly with water, not soap. Apply ice and or a topical benzocaine if skin irritation occurs. Reapply the hair removal cream after 24 hours to finish the hair removal process. Never immediately apply hair retardants/inhibitors or other creams or lotions to the skin if irritation occurs from hair removal cream. It is best to wait 12 to 24 hours before applying any cream or lotion that may increase irritation or sensitivity. If you are allergic to aloe vera, then this product should not be used. For topical hair removal use only. Not for ophthalmic, oral or intra vaginal use.</p>
    <p>Hair Inhibiting Spray/Gel</p>
    <p>Hair No More hair inhibiting spray/gel is 100% safe. Discontinue use if needle like sensations or tingling occurs which is always an indication of irritation.</p>

    <p>Hair No More&trade; is a revolutionary hair removal and hair growth inhibitor system made especially for women and men who are always on the go. Enjoy having smooth, hairless skin all over your body without the hassle and pain of having to shave or wax. Hair No More&trade; makes eliminating un-wanted body hair easy and painless.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Hair Removal Cream</strong></p>
    <p>The Hair Removal Cream safely and effectively removes hair, while protecting the skin against the ravages of ingrown hairs. No more razor burn, rash, pustules, or other problems which have long plagued those searching for effective hair removal.</p>
    <p>Unlike other depilatories, this hair removal cream is sodium free to cut down on irritation. The active ingredients are anhydrous calcium hydroxide and 100% pure calcium thioglycolate with a ph of 12.</p>
    <p>The combination of active ingredients and natural antioxidants &ndash; aloe vera, vitamins A and E, soothing willow bark and butcher broom &ndash; leaves the skin completely hair free, soft, smooth and moisturized.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Hair inhibitor Spray and Gel</strong></p>
    <p>The Hair No More inhibitor products effectively slow and even eliminate new hair growth. Hair inhibiting spray is used on large body areas such as back, chest and legs. Hair growth inhibitor gel is used on small areas such as arms underarms, facial areas, scalp, neck and bikini line.</p>
    <p>Active ingredients are the botanical extract blend of four bioenzymatic plant extracts which comprise 12% (120 mg per g) of pure extract. Also contains green tea extract as an antioxidant and fragrance.</p>
    <p>Other ingredients include the finest aloe vera available, pure glycerin, disodium EDTA, tea carbomer, methylparaben, phenoxethanol, polysorbate 20. All FDA approved ingredients. </p>
    <p>These products do not enter the blood stream. FDA approved ingredients.</p>
    <p><strong>Hair removal cream clinical pharmacology</strong></p>
    <p>There are approximately 60 years of studies confirming the hair removal properties of this product. However, nobody to date has developed a preparation that completely cleans out all the hair down to the follicle site. Our natural hair vanishing cream, in its purest form, removes the entire hair shaft either through melting the hair proteins or lifting the remaining hair out of the shaft. Its deep cleaning properties prevent ingrown hairs and smoothes out razor bumps.</p>
    <p><strong>Hair inhibitors clinical pharmacology</strong></p>
    <p>There are approximately seven years of studies confirming the hair inhibiting effects exhibited by the bio-enzymatic plant enzymes that work at the follicle site to inhibit the regrowth of hair. Combined plant enzymes appear to work on every aspect of the hair shaft and surrounding double helix sulfa bond. Two of the botanicals work on the keratin; one unwinds the tightly wound keratin while the other breaks apart the cell structure inside the hair shaft. The exterior of the hair shaft which is composed of cystine is worked on by a third botanical. The fourth botanical works directly on the sulfa bond to reduce it, thereby eliminating cystine to cystine growth spurts which occur only in the presence of its catalyst, the double helix sulfa bond at the follicle site. The effect thereby eliminates the regrowth of hair, prevents ingrown hair and smoothes out razor bumps.</p>
    <p><strong>Hair removal cream clinical trials</strong></p>
    <p>Results of topical dermal studies for contact sensitization and photo contact irritation reveal that under conditions of clinical use, proper timing and the area well rinsed with water, Hair No More is not expected to cause photosensitization, photo toxic or sensitized reactions. Four years of clinical trials have demonstrated no such reactions in susceptible individuals unless improper timing of removal, allowing the cream to dry on skin, or failure to rinse thoroughly with water has occurred.</p>
    <p>Results appear to be similar to waxing in which similar timing for hair regrowth occurs. The only difference between waxing and Hair No More hair removal cream is the matrix healing time created by waxing as the hair is ripped from the skin. The clinical comparisons between the hair removal cream and other depilatories demonstrate the superiority over all others in the marketplace.</p>
    <p>The advantages of using Hair No More hair removal cream over waxing are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>It can be used immediately upon regrowth of hair stubble </li>
        <li>It prevents ingrown hairs, and </li>
        <li>It leaves the skin baby soft, smooth and protected from the environment. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The green tea fragrance, which is a natural antioxidant in its pure form, has clinically been proven to protect the skin from environment damage 100 times greater than the available vitamin C creams.</p>
    <p><strong>Hair inhibitors clinical trials</strong></p>
    <p>Results of topical dermal studies for contact sensitization and photo contact reveal that daily use of Hair No More hair inhibiting spray is not expected to cause any known side effects. Seven years of clinical trials have demonstrated no such reactions in susceptible individuals unless the hair inhibiting spray is applied immediately to already irritated skin cause by shaving too closely, improper use of depilatories which irritate the skin or other skin irritants which may have been applied prior to using Hair No More hair inhibiting spray, i.e. acne abrasion and chemical peels.</p>
    <p>For best results, prior complete hair removal down to the follicle site is recommended either through waxing, sugaring, or use of Hair No More hair removal cream, as the hair inhibiting works mainly at the follicle site. Shaving or other depilatories may be used to remove the hair but results will take longer to achieve because there is still hair in the pore somewhat blocking the hair inhibitor from immediately reaching the follicle site.</p>
    <p>In some cases a hair shaft may be so thick that it precludes gel or spray hair retardant from reaching the follicle site in which case the hair must be removed completely using Hair No More hair removal cream, waxing, sugaring, electrolysis, or laser surgery. In rare cases, tensile strength of hair fiber may be so great as to prevent hair removal cream from working during its required time and patient must resort to other means of hair removal for the next 3 to 6 weeks with daily applications of hair removal spray to reduce the volume and tensile strength of the hair shaft. Applying the removal cream afterward should then remove the hair down to the follicle site.</p>
    <p>The advantages of Hair No More hair inhibitors over other inhibitors are (1) can be used anywhere on the skin and prevents regrowth without skin reactions, (2) prevents ingrown hairs, (3) leaves the skin baby soft and smooth and protected from the environment. The fragrance green tea, a natural antioxidant in its pure form, has clinically been proven to protect the skin from environmental damage 100% greater than the available vitamin C creams.</p>

The hair growth should \r\n        be at least 1/8 of an inch or 3 mm. Apply a thin layer of gel evenly in \r\n        the direction of hair growth. When placing the cotton reusable strip over \r\n        the gel-coated area, leave a small space at the end of the strip for pulling. \r\n        Before pulling, apply firm pressure on the strip while rubbing in a quick \r\n        up and down motion. Do not lift the cotton strip out or away, but pull \r\n        parallel to the skin in a swift motion. Always pull the strip in the opposite \r\n        direction of hair growth. Hold the skin firmly with one hand before pulling \r\n        to ease the hair removing process. You may reuse the same gel coated cotton \r\n        strip over the same/other areas until gel is fully used. Applying the \r\n        gel, placing of cotton strip and pulling it back technique is important. \r\n        If done properly you will eliminate any pain that might be associated \r\n        in the process. Many people find less pain using sugaring gel because \r\n        sugaring gel tends to stick to the hair and not the skin unlike waxing. \r\n        You will experience virtually no pain with its repeated use. Using a wash \r\n        cloth rinsed in warm water, wipe skin after the treatment. Do not over \r\n        heat the gel. </P>\r\n      <P><FONT color=\"006666\"><STRONG>Comparison chart</STRONG></FONT><BR>\r\n        <IMG src=\"http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/images/graph_sugaring.gif\" alt=\"sugaring hair temoval gel \" width=\"360\" height=\"200\"> </P>\r\n      <P><FONT color=\"006666\"><STRONG>Warnings and precautions<BR>\r\n        </STRONG></FONT>For external use only.

  name: Parissa Chamomile Body Sugaring Hair Removal Sticks
  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:29
  dosage: |-
    <p><strong>Areas of Use</strong></p>
    <p>Legs, body and face. </p>
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <p>Heat Body Sugar to the consistency of liquid honey and retain at that consistency throughout process for best results.</p>
    <p>Microwave: remove cap and seal. Place in center of unit and heat on High for ~20 seconds. As microwaves vary, always test temperature before use.</p>
    <p>Lamp: Place directly under reading lamp for ~20 minutes.</p>
    <p>Wash skin with soap and water or oil-free toner. Dry well.</p>
    <p>Hint: in hot weather or when perspiring, apply talc sparingly. Have a damp cloth handy during process and lay a towel beneath you for tidiness. Always check direction of hair growth before beginning. Proceed quickly and confidently.</p>
    <p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 week rule: previously shaved hair is strong and resistant. Wait 2 weeks or until hair is ~1/4&quot;(1/2cm) long before use. </li>
        <li>Less is better &ndash; the thinner you spread the product the better the results. </li>
        <li>Always spread in direction of hair growth. Strip off in opposite direction. </li>
        <li>Always pull strip back along itself in one quick movement. Don't peel or pull of slowly. </li>
        <li>The faster the strip is removed the better the result. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For Legs: Smooth on using edge of spatula. Spread paper-thin layer of body sugar in direction of hair growth. Apply strip immediately after applying body sugar. Smooth down strip over sugared area leaving end of strip extended beyond sugar. Rub strip to adhere well. Hold skin taut below strip with one hand. Use other to grasp lower end of strip and tug quickly in opposite direction of hair growth, keeping strip/hand as close and as parallel to the skin as possible.</p>
    <p>Hint: The faster the strip is removed, the better the result. Repeat. (The same strip can be used more than once.)</p>
    <p>For bikini line: Trim hair to 1/2'&quot;(1cm) with scissors. Area is sensitive so work in small patches. Bend leg outward, stretch skin with one hand and strip off with other hand against hair growth.</p>
    <p>For underarm: Clean and dry area well and apply talc sparingly if perspiring. Place arm behind head as far back as possible to tauten skin. Check direction of hair growth carefully as it varies widely. Work on upper and lower half of underarm separately.</p>
    <p>Upper lip: Keep lips taut over teeth. Work on only &frac12; of area at a time. Spread sugar evenly and thinly from center to outer corner. Keep skin taut while stripping off and then apply pressure to stripped area to minimize discomfort. Soothe and cool area with ice cube.</p>
    <p>After care: When finished, rinse skin with cold or lukewarm water or take a shower. Apply soothing, moisturizing azulene oil daily to retain smoothness and suppleness, inhibit regrowth, prevent ingrown hair and boost skin cell regeneration.</p>
    <p>Try Parissa Quick and Easy Wax Strips for touch ups. High skin sensitivity may occur after first trial, but decreases with ensuing use as hair weakens. Regrowth varies per person, appearing anywhere from 4-8 weeks. Skin often turns pink and spotty after hair removal, but should disappear in a few hours. If irritation persists discontinue use. Do not use deodorants or antiperspirants for 24 hours after underarm application.</p>

            </strong></font>Increase the health of your pet's coat with this anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, insect repellant soap.       <P>Bathing your dog too frequently can lead to dry skin and irritation. 
            Once a month should suffice. This will help to prevent the loss of natural 
            skin oils that keep the skin moisturized. Also, dogs that spend a lot 
            of time out side are at a higher risk of skin irritation and skin breakage. 
            Pay attention to the plants and insects your dog is around, in case they 
            have an allergic reaction to any of them or are severely bitten. Indoor 
            dogs are also at risk, so make sure to keep away any potentially poisonous 
            plants and keep medicine locked up.

This extract has shown to contain excellent tolerance and non-toxicity \r\n        properties. The panel taking part in the study consisted of adult female \r\n        subjects, between 21 and 42 years of age who has stretch marks on the \r\n        abdomen, thighs, hips, buttocks and/or breasts. According to the subjects, \r\n        the stretch marks had resulted from one or more pregnancies, fluctuation \r\n        in bodyweight, or rapid growth in size. </P>\r\n      <p>The cream was applied by each subject twice daily for 4 consecutive weeks. \r\n        The subjects were examined before the start of the study and after day \r\n        28. The determinations were carried out under specified environmental \r\n        conditions of temperature and relative humidity, which were checked for \r\n        each subject. The results were obtained comparing the biometric parameters \r\n        \"Local Skin Irregularities\", \"Depth and Length of the \r\n        Striae\", \"Indented and Smooth Surfaces\" obtained before \r\n        and after treatment and by analyzing the subjective assessments of the \r\n        panel subjects. Analysis of the biometric parameters clearly showed improvements \r\n        in the skin irregularities and striae after 4 weeks of treatment. This \r\n        improvement was observed in 93% of the subjects. The skin was also more \r\n        uniform and stretch marks tended to fade. The quantitative results are \r\n        summarized below:</p>\r\n      <p>Length of Streak: -52% reduction<br>\r\n        Deep Surfaces: -55% reduction<br>\r\n        Mean Dept of Surfaces: -13% reduction<br>\r\n        Surface Smoothness: +14% increase<br>\r\n        Percent of subjects <br>\r\n        with improvement: +93%</p>\r\n      <p>In conclusion, the cream containing the special extract of Seigesbeckia \r\n        Orientallis L. plant has shown dramatic results in application of anti-stretch \r\n        mark treatment. </p>\r\n      <p>Study 2: Clinical Evaluation + In Vivo Test: Anti-Wrinkle and Skin Repair \r\n        (wound healing) Activity Against Placebo</p>\r\n      <p>A clinical evaluation study was conducted to test the anti-wrinkle and \r\n        skin repair efficacy of a topical cream containing 2 peptides, Palmitoyl \r\n        Tetrapeptide-3 and Palmitoyl Oligopeptide against placebo. </p>\r\n      <p>A group of subject between 39 and 74 years of age were selected to participate \r\n        in the study. Subjects were free from history of allergy and skin lesions, \r\n        and were not receiving any medicinal treatment that might have interfered \r\n        with the results of the study. The anti-aging/anti-wrinkle effect was \r\n        assessed using profilometry, image analysis, photography and cutometry. \r\n        The cream was applied morning and night for 2 months, where \"crow\xE2\x80\x99s \r\n        feet\" were clearly visible. Subjects were instructed to refrain \r\n        from using any other wrinkle, operative or regenerative product.<br>\r\n        After 56 days, a very significant improvement, in all aspects of measurement, \r\n        was seen in areas treated with Tetrapeptide-3 over placebo:</p>\r\n      <p>Wrinkle Area: -110% reduction<br>\r\n        Wrinkle Density: -71% reduction<br>\r\n        Wrinkle Depth : -84% reduction<br>\r\n        Wrinkle Volume: -63% reduction<br>\r\n        Roughness: -109 % reduction<br>\r\n        Skin tone: -58% Increase</p>\r\n      <p>Study 3: Clinical Evaluation \xE2\x80\x93 In Vivo Test: Anti-Wrinkle and Skin \r\n        Repair (wound-healing) Activity.

The Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-3 combined \r\n        with Palmitoyl Oligopeptide in the product showed a complementary gene \r\n        activation profile with stimulation of protein remodeling and cell proliferation. \r\n        In vitro, and the 2 peptides showed synergistic effects on the synthesis \r\n        of collagen I, fibronetin and hyaluronic and hyaluronic acid.

    <p><strong>What is dog hypothyroidism?</strong></p>
    <p>A dog's thyroid is a gland in his neck and controls his metabolism and body growth. When this gland produces too much or too little thyroid hormones, health problems follow.</p>
    <p>Thyroid conditions are very common in both cats and dogs. Cats more commonly suffer from hyperthyroidism, an overactive thyroid. Dogs more the opposite: they're more likely to suffer from hypothyroidism, which is an under-active thyroid. Though not life-threatening, canine hypothyroidism can profoundly effect your dog&rsquo;s appearance and quality of life. </p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms of canine hypothyroidism:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dull-looking coat </li>
        <li>Greasy skin with a pronounced odor than clings to your fingers </li>
        <li>Low energy level </li>
        <li>Weight gain </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you suspect your dog has hypothyroidism (the weight gain and dull, smelly coat are usually the first clues) you should consult your vet for an accurate diagnosis. There are, of course, other causes of weight gain and poor coat.</p>
    <p><strong>Traditional treatments for hypothyroidism in dogs</strong></p>
    <p>The standard treatment consists of daily doses of synthetic thyroid hormone. Though this treatment can certainly work, there's one major problem: it is very difficult to determine the proper dosage. The result: your dog may suffer from having too much thyroid hormone!</p>
    <p><strong>Natural treatment: Thyro-Up</strong></p>
    <p>An all-natural, herbal product, Thyro-Up contains no synthetic hormones. Instead, it improves your dog's thyroid functioning so that it increases production of its own, natural thyroid hormones. As a result, all major symptoms of canine hypothyroidism are addressed.</p>
    <p>Thyro-Up is completely safe for long-term use. There is no danger of overproduction of thyroid hormones, and no harmful side effects. It is a terrific product, highly recommended by our customers.</p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;When my black lab started slowing down and gaining weight, I thought it was just natural aging (even though she's only six.) It turned out, however, that she had an under-active thyroid. We put her on Thyro-Up, and very quickly we noticed that her energy level returned. Then her weight started coming off. It's just great to have my old dog back!&quot; Valerie P., Fort Lee NJ</p>
    <p><img height="258" width="400" src="/UserFiles/Image/dog-testimonial-thyroid.jpg" alt="canine thyroid treatment" /></p>
    <p>&quot;My vet can't believe how well Thyro-Up worked for my dog, Bowser. We&rsquo;ve completely weaned him off the synthetic hormones he was on and there's been no recurrence of symptoms. It feels great to know Bowser doesn't have to take drugs any more. He now looks and acts great without them.&quot; Pete, Oakland CA</p>

    <p><strong>More About Strain Ease </strong></p>
    <p>Strain Ease not only has the ability to reduce a person's pain, but also if used long-term, has the ability to <strong>actually promote tissue repair and healing.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Strain Ease was formulated based on an ancient, time-tested medicinal science. It alleviates the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis, rheumatism, tendonitis, back aches, strains, sprains, carpal tunnel syndrome, myositis/myofascitis, fibromyalgia, soft tissue injuries and neuralgia.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Strain Ease has been CLINICALLY TESTED.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>When applied externally to the skin, the formula's counter-irritant and topical analgesic properties provide symptomatic relief from pain and discomfort associated with many aches and pains of muscles and joints.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The counterirritant substance dilates the small blood vessels and brings blood closer to the skins surface, producing increased circulation and warmth. The increase in blood flow to the joint or muscle speeds up the healing process. Consequently, coetaneous receptors are stimulated to induce sensations such as warmth, which serve to distract from the deep-seated pain in areas such as muscles, joints, and tendons, which are distant from the skin's surface where Strain Ease is being applied.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The formulation contains blood-purifying properties which help with the absorption of herbs that otherwise can be restricted due to inflammation. It contains anticoagulants, causing blood to remain liquid instead of coagulating, thus helping circulation.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The topical analgesic agent depresses cutaneous sensory receptors for pain and itching and acts directly to diminish or obliterate these symptoms on the skin.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Other ingredients in Strain Ease also have the additional effect to producing vasodilatation of cutaneous vasculature, widening of the capillaries in the skin. This rubefacient effect increases blood pooling and/or flow, accompanied by an increase in localized skin temperature.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The action of counterirritants in relieving pain has a strong psychological effect through pleasant aroma and the sensations of warmth on the skin. Tissues entered include plasma, lymph, red blood cells, muscle tissue, connective tissues and adipose tissue.</strong></p>
    <p><strong><strong>Clinical Pharmacology</strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Strain Ease was formulated based on an ancient Eastern Ayurvedic formula that is thousands of years old, with records of use in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia. It's tried and time tested in South East Asia.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Strain Ease has been clinically tested in Boston under the supervision of Dr. Cherrubino, a highly respected and reputable Chiropractic Doctor who has several years of clinical practice. The participants had to be suffering from pain of muscle and or joint origin with a degree of constant pain for greater than one week. Participants were not allowed to use any other pain relievers. The results of the clinical study indicated that 93.6% of the users experienced significant reduction while only 6.45% experienced no pain reduction.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>In short, Strain Ease is a safe and effective topical pain reliever that is all natural, providing an effective remedy without harmful side effects.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>What is dog hyperthyroidism?</strong><br />Hyperthyroid pets often lose weight despite a normal appetite and become nervous and irritable. For several days they may be hyperactive and have a rapid heart beat, then lethargic, apathetic and uninterested in food, play or grooming. Thyroid imbalances are extremely common in North American pets. In cats, the problem is most often an overactive thyroid. In dogs, it&rsquo;s the opposite: hypothyroidism (an under active thyroid) is much more widespread.</p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms of canine hyperthyroidism:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hyperactivity </li>
        <li>Weight loss </li>
        <li>Increased appetite </li>
        <li>Vomiting or diarrhea </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Canine Resthyro is an all natural herbal tonic, carefully crafted to balance thyroid hyperactivity. </p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word...</strong><br />&quot;Before Resthyro Ziggy's weight was down, his fur was dull and matted. I could see a change in his all over well being. In approx. 2 weeks after giving Resthyro I saw a noticeable improvement, and now with some TLC and and the Resthyro he has gained weight and his temperament and fur has improved at least 85%.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Yes, the vets spent six months trying to help him. Now, we've had him on this two months and he's almost ready to be off of the xanax the vet prescribed him for the anxiety the high thyroid caused him. He had noticeable changes within one week of taking this mix.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Yes, she seems much better since I started her on Resthyro. She didn't tolerate the regular medication from the vet, but seems to be doing quite well now. Plus, I can just mix it with her food, so she doesn't even know she's getting it.&quot;</p>

    <p>If you&rsquo;re suffering from the symptoms of herpes, give Herp Ease a try. A great alternative to chemical treatments, Herp Ease is all natural &ndash; and it really works!</p>
    <p><strong>What is Herpes?</strong></p>
    <p>There are more than ninety viruses belonging to the herpes family. The most commonly known are herpes zoster and herpes simplex 1 and 2. Herpes simplex 1 and 2 occur on different parts of the body. Fatigue, a possible fever and a mild tingling where the blister is going to develop precede both types. The blister itself is painful, visible as a fluid filled skin eruption that will crust over and heal. The whole process can last about two to three weeks.</p>
    <p>Herpes simplex 1 occurs on the lips and face. While between forty and eighty percent of the population is infected with the virus, only twenty to forty percent experience symptoms.</p>
    <p>Herpes type 2 occurs in the genital region in men and women. The blisters can occur on the exterior skin, as well as within the genitals. Herpes simplex type 2 is the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States; one out of every six people has the virus. The danger that females have is that they may be infected and be unaware of it, then infect their partner during sex. Herpes simplex 2 can also cause problems during childbirth as it may be passed to the child as it goes through the birth canal.</p>
    <p>Herpes can be triggered by stress, exposure to extreme weather, fatigue, and poor nutrition. Herp Ease helps to prevent or reduce the symptoms of this viral infection.</p>

    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>Spectral RS&reg; works by addressing multiple causes that lead to thinning hair such as perifollicular fibrosis and internal factors such as stress, hormonal disturbances, lack of vitamins and mineral salts, and the use of certain medications.&nbsp; Perifollicular fibrosis is a condition that accompanies all hair loss whereby the collagen around the hair root becomes rigid and tightens, pushing the root to the surface and causing premature hair loss. Other ingredients in Spectral RS&reg; help improve the nutrition, circulation, and metabolism of the follicle. </p>
    <p>Nanosome Encapsulation Technology<br />Nanosomes are tiny organic micro-spheres that penetrate into the lowest levels of the skin and gradually release the ingredients over a 15 hour period.&nbsp; All ingredients are derived from highest purity organic sources and work synergistically to deliver maximum results in the treatment of thinning hair.</p>

    <p><strong>What is cat hyperthyroidism?</strong></p>
    <p>Hyperthyroidism is very common with middle-aged and older cats. It results when the thyroid glands (located near the cat&rsquo;s windpipe) produce too much thyroid hormone.</p>
    <p>Hyperthyroid pets often lose weight despite a normal appetite and become nervous, irritable and vocal. For several days, they may be hyperactive and have a rapid heart beat, then lethargic, apathetic and uninterested in food, play or grooming. </p>
    <p>Thyroid imbalances are extremely common in North American pets. In cats, the problem is most often an overactive thyroid. In dogs, it&rsquo;s the opposite: hypothyroidism (an under active thyroid) is much more widespread.</p>
    <p><strong>Symptoms of feline hyperthyroidism:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hyperactivity, irritability, increased yowling </li>
        <li>Weight loss </li>
        <li>Increased appetite </li>
        <li>Occasional vomiting or diarrhea </li>
        <li>Poor quality (matted and dull) coat </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you suspect your cat has an overactive thyroid, you should consult your vet. Traditional treatments include radioactive iodine therapy, surgical removal of the thyroid gland, and ongoing treatment with anti-thyroid medications.</p>
    <p><strong>Natural, herbal treatment for cat hyperthyroidism</strong></p>
    <p>For those who prefer non-surgical, natural treatments, we offer Resthyro for Cat Hyperthyroidism. Carefully formulated by a leading naturopathic veterinarian, this very popular product is loaded with a powerful combination of seven different herbal extracts. Together, they are very effective in treating feline hyperthyroidism:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Balances thyroid function (inhibits over-production of thyroid hormones) </li>
        <li>Improves cardiovascular functions </li>
        <li>Relieves tension and irritability </li>
        <li>Improves digestion </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An all-natural product, Resthyro has no adverse side effects and is safe for long-term use.</p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the final word&hellip;</strong><br />&ldquo;I have always had cats and, thankfully, over the years they have all been fairly healthy and lived to a great old age. Recently though, my calico, Jezebel started getting a bit hyperactive and losing a bit of weight even though she was eating more than usual. As this had never happened before, I got her looked at by our vet. A few tests later, I was told that she had hyperthyroidism which, in cats, can be quite common. </p>
    <p>The next thing I did was search the web for natural products to help control the condition and this is when I came across your site and Resthyro. I may not have used it before, but this is one great product for helping control Hyperthyroidism in Cats. Jezebel is more stable now, her weight loss has stopped, her energy levels are back to normal and all is well. Thanks you, I will recommend you to others&rdquo;<br />Leigh in&nbsp; New York, NY</p>

    <p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Testimonial</font><br />I have to admit that I was skeptical at first but this product has really helped our Hyperthyroid cat.&nbsp; She is 14 years old and I did not want to subject her to surgeries and medication with bad side effects.&nbsp; She has been on it for 3 months and has actually gained a pound, where as before she was losing weight like crazy. She is back to her old self and I believe this product worked for her.... thanks!</p>

    <p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Testimonial</font><br />Product works very well for my cat she is eating better, grooming better and has gained at least 2 pounds. Product far easier to give over thyroid pills. <br />Kathy G. Fort Plain, NY </p>
    <p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Testimonial</font><br />&quot;Since we started the resthyro our cat has not lost any additional weight. He may have even gained a half pound. Originally our vet wanted to medicate him and run blood tests every two weeks. I would have been giving our cat an injection daily. Due to the high costs involved and two children in college I could not afford a $1,000/ month vet fee. Our cat is still highly active every day. He goes on his morning and evening prowls as if he was a young cat again. The medication has not only kept our cat alive but it has also improved his activity level. &quot;</p>
    <p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Testimonial</font><br />&quot;Blessings to your company for providing alternatives that really work.</p>
    <p>We received Resthyro on Friday and gave Chan his first dose. Saturday morning he was given his second. The improvement was immediate. The poor guy had been having watery loose bowel movements 6-8 times a day over the past 6 months. In the first 24 hours on Resthyro he dropped to 2 semi-formed stools.</p>
    <p>We're now into the third day and he hasn't had a bowel movement since late yesterday afternoon. His water consumption is way down and he's resting quietly. We know he has a long way to go before he's healthily again. Now we have hope.&quot;</p>
    <p>Sincerely, Charly Makray-Rice</p>
    <p><font style="font-weight: bold;">Testimonial</font><br />Hello, I have reordered the above product, and would like to write a testimonial. <br />You might want to add my review.<br />After one month, my 18 year old cat, Shasta has gained a solid 2 lbs! Her coat looks better and the product really seems to helping her hyperthyroidism.<br />Thank you,<br />Stacey Caron<br />Summit, NJ</p>

    <p>Contains no artificial preservatives, colors, dairy products, sweeteners, starch, wheat or yeast.</p>
    <p>
    Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract 50:1 25 mg: Ginkgo Biloba can help cerebral vascular circulation, enhance mental performance and brain function, as well as help with muscular degeneration, impotence and erectile dysfunction. The main active components (flavoglycosides and terpene lactones) are known to have antioxidant properties which can isolate and remove free radicals. These actives also decrease inflammation by inhibiting the formation of platelets in the circulatory system.
    </p>
    <p>Maca: Maca acts to restore male libido to a healthy level. Maca's active components - glucosinolates - are known to help enhance fertility. Maca helps restore hormonal balance and regulate testosterone, progesterone and estrogen levels.</p>
    <p>Panax Ginseng: Panax Ginseng has been used to treat conditions of weakness, tiredness, low resistance, aging, stress, poor metabolism and mental fatigue. Panax Ginseng helps increase resistance to infections, stimulates the central nervous system, and improves overall physical energy and performance.</p>
    <p>Muira Puama: The origin of this Brazilian herb is the Amazon Rain forest. Traditionally, it has been used as an energy and fertility enhancer. The primary function of Muira Puama is as a remedy for male impotence and sexual dysfunction. Muira Puama also helps the nervous system when the body is under stress, and acts as a tonic for overall health.</p>
    <p>Tribulus Terrestris: Tribulus terrestris helps to restore and improve the male libido, as well as improve and prolong the duration of erection. It stimulates spermatogenesis (sperm production) by increasing the number of spermatozoa and their mobility. Tribulus terrestris also helps increase the body's level of testosterone, reduce cholesterol and high blood pressure, and inhibits blood platelet formation, as well as regulate liver and kidney function.</p>
    <p>Horny Goat Weed (Epimedium): The principal use of the herb is as an aphrodisiac. Epimedium has also been used to help treat disorders of the kidneys and liver, and helps relieve back and knee pain. Epimedium appears to have two main mechanisms of action which increase sexual performance. It has been shown to increase the levels of testosterone in the body. It has also been shown that Epimedium is capable of inhibiting the enzyme acetycholinesterase (A ChE) which inactivates cholinergic neurotransmitters. The activity of these cholinergic neurotransmitters is key to sexual arousal and performance. By inhibiting the A ChE, Epimedium may increase sexual arousal and performance.</p>
    <p>Saw Palmetto: The main active components are a variety of fatty acids and phytosterols. These fatty acid compounds have been found to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to a more potent hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Saw Palmetto has been used to treat not only the enlargement of the prostate, but also treat atrophy of the testes, male libido, impotence, as well as hair loss and urinary tract disorders.</p>
    <p>Ligustrum: Ligustrum has been found to exhibit several pharmacological properties. These include anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, and diuretic properties. Ligustrum has been found to help regulate and enhance both liver and kidney function.</p>
    <p>Royal Jelly: Royal Jelly is a high concentrated food produced by worker honeybees. Royal Jelly is a rich source of protein containing all of the essential amino acids, as well as unsaturated fats, vitamins and minerals. Royal Jelly has been shown to stimulate the suprarenal glands, which enhance the body's metabolism. The effect on the rate of metabolism by Royal Jelly is increased energy, increased appetite and enhanced sexual performance. Royal Jelly has also been used to treat allergies, arthritis, weight loss, vascular conditions, and in general the aging process. </p>

    <p><strong>Herbal Aphrodisiac &ndash; Restore Your Libido and Virility </strong></p>
    <p>Impotence (the inability to achieve or maintain an erection) is a problem for many men. There may be psychological reasons for impotence and these should be investigated. However, the major cause is often damage to the blood vessels that supply blood to the penis. The male erection is a result of increased blood flow to the penis, and if blood cannot reach the penis in sufficient amounts, then an erection does not occur.</p>
    <p>Factors that can contribute to impotence include smoking, diabetes, stress, arteriosclerosis, and medications (such as those for lowering blood pressure and treating depression). </p>
    <p>Sexual health allows for satisfying, intimate relationships; impotence can be psychologically devastating. The treatment of impotence involves removing these causative factors. Using Vigor-O Men is a great start!</p>

    <p><strong>The Complete Hair Loss Solution: Nisim Tri Pack</strong></p>
    <p>Each of these hair-loss products can be used on its own. But they were originally designed to be used together. And for the most effective hair loss treatment, that&rsquo;s what we recommend.</p>
    <p><strong>Hair Loss Shampoo</strong></p>
    <p>Nisim Hair Loss Shampoo effectively removes the build up of sweat, oils, and dirt on the scalp, leaving a clean and nutrient-rich environment for healthy hair growth. But more importantly, it neutralizes DHT &ndash; the most common cause of hair loss.</p>
    <p><strong>Conditioner</strong></p>
    <p>This ultra-rich, deep conditioner penetrates into the roots of your hair. It instantly improves the texture and appearance of your hair, leaving even dull and brittle hair feeling thicker and fuller.</p>
    <p><strong>Stimulating Hair Regrowth Extract</strong></p>
    <p>The final and most important step, Nisim Stimulating Extract is the only non-pharmaceutical product that&rsquo;s been scientifically and medically proven to re-stimulate hair growth. See clinical study, below.</p>
    <p><strong>Clinical study &ndash; Hair Loss and Hair Regrowth</strong></p>
    <p>One-hundred and forty-eight participants with varying degrees of male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) participated in an open-ended study using an all natural compound solution to determine the effects of hair re-growth. The participants were photographed and initial hair counts were done in a 2.5 cm diameter area of their balding scalp. After five months of treatment, the participants were re-photographed and hair counts were done on the same 2.5 cm diameter area of the scalp. The results indicate that 85.7% of the men in the study had an increase in their terminal hairs of 30% or greater. When evaluating the percent increase more closely, we find that we can break the data down into three separate groups.</p>
    <p>Showing significant re-growth was 40.8% of the study group who had an increase of 100% or greater (doubling, tripling, or more) of terminal hairs counted on their five month post-treatment photo as compared to their initial pre-treatment photo. Of this group, the highest increase of hairs was 472%, and the lowest increase was 102% with the mean at 193.7% increase of hairs.</p>
    <p>The group of men showing moderate re-growth, which we classed as 30%-100% increase in terminal hair re-growth, was 44.9% of the study group. The mean increase of that group was a 61.5% increase of hair re-growth.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the group, classed as no change, was 14.3% of the study group, with an average of 6.7% increase in re-growth</p>
    <p>Participants were told to use at least one bottle per month (five bottles in five months) but were allowed to use more if desired. We did not see any significant advantage to using more than one bottle per month. Our conclusion is that the stimulatory effect of the compound is achieved at the use rate of one bottle per month.</p>
    <p>The age range of the participants in their ability to restore hair growth was not a factor. The range of the participants in this study was 24-68 years old, with the average age being 38.7 years.</p>
    <p>In summary, this study concludes that the natural herbal extract solution has a stimulatory effect on restoring hair growth for at least 8 out of 10 men with androgenic alopecia (balding). The earlier stages of balding appear to respond to a higher degree, but significant improvement was seen in participants at all stages of baldness. There appears to be an optimum rate of use of the product, and age does not seem to be a factor in response.</p>
    <p>Although the qualitative and quantitative assessments were done independently, there was a strong correlation between the two groups. Overall, 88% of the qualitative group showed some degree of improvement. Of the group studied quantitatively, 85.7% showed a degree of re-growth (within 95% confidence limits). With the qualitative group, 6 of 50 men were categorized as having no change (category 0), representing 12% of the total. In the quantitative group (98 participants), 14 men, or 14.3% did not show any increase in hair counts. The average hair count increase for this group was 6.7%. So most subjects in this group did regrow some hair, but not a noticeable amount.</p>
    <p>The moderately improved qualitative group (category 1) consisted of 16 participants, or 32%. In the quantitatively studied group, 44 of 98 men fell into the range of +30% to +100%. This represents 44.9% of the men. The range of increase was 32% to 98%, with the mean at 61.5% The participants showing significant re-growth in the qualitative group (category 2) were 28 of 50, or 56%. In the quantitatively studied group, the number of men with significant re-growth (greater than 100%) was 40 of 98, or 40.8%. These men had hair count increases of 100% or more. The range of hair count increases was 102% to 472%, with a mean increase of 194%. The photograph of these men and women showed significant cosmetic changes which correlates very well with our quantitative findings.</p>
    <p>From the photos taken monthly during the course of the study, a pattern of re-growth was observed in those participants who demonstrated a significant increase in hair counts over the five months. The first countable hairs were seen after 10-12 weeks of treatment and were first detected on the crown or vertex of the head. Following further treatment, hair was then observed re-growing in the thinning or balding areas of the scalp. Hair re-growth in the fronto-temporal region of the scalp was noted after 16-20 weeks of treatment, and this region appeared to be the most resistant to re-growth to date.</p>
    <p>This open-ended study has demonstrated the hair re-growth response of 148 men who have been treated with an all natural compound solution applied topically to balding or thinning regions of the scalp. The treatment program included regular scalp cleansing with a natural extract scalp cleanser and application of at least 5-10 ml of the all natural compound solution at least twice daily. The data showed that hair counts increased significantly for approximately 85% of the participants in the five month period.</p>
    <p>The study methodology implies that the results obtained relate not only to the all natural compound solution used in the treatment, but also the overall treatment regimen. From previous minoxidil (Rogaine) papers, it was determined by them that a reasonable expectation for a &quot;placebo-type&quot; effect was a 10-15% increase in hair counts. Thus, by setting the cut-off in this study for moderate re-growth at a 30% increase, any increase due to a &quot;placebo-type&quot; effect is discounted.</p>
    <p>An attempt was made to correlate the response (either no change, moderate change, or significant change) with a number of factors. None of the factors studied gave a strong correlation, although there were some trends noted. The number of years of balding or thinning hair did not appear to have any correlation with the final results. However, it should be noted that the number of years thinning was a number given by the participants, and could not be verified accurately. Thus it is a subject of assessment and may not be very reliable. To help balance this uncertainty, the results were grouped. Regardless of the groupings used, there was no grouping which demonstrated a significant correlation with results.</p>
    <p>In terms of hair re-growth, this all natural compound solution appears to be more effective than minoxidil (Rogaine) and has no known side effects. A study by Alanis showed that a 2% minoxidil preparation applied topically increased hair counts by about 24% after 20 weeks. This study showed an increase of 89% in the same time period. Because of the differences in locating the measured regions of the scalp, these results are not directly comparable, but in a population study, Alanis's results showed that 34-46 out of 83 participants (48%) had no growth after 24 weeks, whereas our results show only 14 out of 98 (14%) had no growth after 20 weeks.</p>
    <p>Thus, our conclusion is that this product does stimulate re-growth of hair in cases of androgenic alopecia (balding), and that over 85% of men will respond favorably to the treatment.</p>

    <p><strong>The Complete Hair Loss Solution: Nisim Tri Pack</strong></p>
    <p>Each of these hair loss products can be used on their own. But they were originally designed to be used together. And for the ultimate in hair regrowth, that&rsquo;s what we recommend.</p>
    <p><strong>Hair Loss Shampoo</strong></p>
    <p>Nisim Hair Loss Shampoo effectively removes the build up of sweat, oils, and dirt on the scalp, leaving a clean and nutrient-rich environment for healthy hair growth. But more importantly, it neutralizes DHT &ndash; the most common cause of hair loss.</p>
    <p><strong>Conditioner</strong></p>
    <p>This ultra-rich, deep conditioner penetrates into the roots of your hair. It instantly improves the texture and appearance of your hair, leaving even dull and brittle hair feeling thicker and fuller.</p>
    <p><strong>Stimulating Hair Regrowth Extract</strong></p>
    <p>The final and most important step, Nisim Stimulating Extract is the only non-pharmaceutical product that&rsquo;s been scientifically and medically proven to re-stimulate hair growth. See clinical study, below.</p>
    <p><strong>Clinical study &ndash; Hair Loss and Hair Regrowth</strong></p>
    <p>One-hundred and forty-eight participants with varying degrees of male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) participated in an open-ended study using an all natural compound solution to determine the effects of hair re-growth. The participants were photographed and initial hair counts were done in a 2.5 cm diameter area of their balding scalp. After five months of treatment, the participants were re-photographed and hair counts were done on the same 2.5 cm diameter area of the scalp. The results indicate that 85.7% of the men in the study had an increase in their terminal hairs of 30% or greater. When evaluating the percent increase more closely, we find that we can break the data down into three separate groups.</p>
    <p>Showing significant re-growth was 40.8% of the study group who had an increase of 100% or greater (doubling, tripling, or more) of terminal hairs counted on their five month post-treatment photo as compared to their initial pre-treatment photo. Of this group, the highest increase of hairs was 472%, and the lowest increase was 102% with the mean at 193.7% increase of hairs.</p>
    <p>The group of men showing moderate re-growth, which we classed as 30%-100% increase in terminal hair re-growth, was 44.9% of the study group. The mean increase of that group was a 61.5% increase of hair re-growth.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the group, classed as no change, was 14.3% of the study group, with an average of 6.7% increase in re-growth</p>
    <p>Participants were told to use at least one bottle per month (five bottles in five months) but were allowed to use more if desired. We did not see any significant advantage to using more than one bottle per month. Our conclusion is that the stimulatory effect of the compound is achieved at the use rate of one bottle per month.</p>
    <p>The age range of the participants in their ability to restore hair growth was not a factor. The range of the participants in this study was 24-68 years old, with the average age being 38.7 years.</p>
    <p>In summary, this study concludes that the natural herbal extract solution has a stimulatory effect on restoring hair growth for at least 8 out of 10 men with androgenic alopecia (balding). The earlier stages of balding appear to respond to a higher degree, but significant improvement was seen in participants at all stages of baldness. There appears to be an optimum rate of use of the product, and age does not seem to be a factor in response.</p>
    <p>Although the qualitative and quantitative assessments were done independently, there was a strong correlation between the two groups. Overall, 88% of the qualitative group showed some degree of improvement. Of the group studied quantitatively, 85.7% showed a degree of re-growth (within 95% confidence limits). With the qualitative group, 6 of 50 men were categorized as having no change (category 0), representing 12% of the total. In the quantitative group (98 participants), 14 men, or 14.3% did not show any increase in hair counts. The average hair count increase for this group was 6.7%. So most subjects in this group did regrow some hair, but not a noticeable amount.</p>
    <p>The moderately improved qualitative group (category 1) consisted of 16 participants, or 32%. In the quantitatively studied group, 44 of 98 men fell into the range of +30% to +100%. This represents 44.9% of the men. The range of increase was 32% to 98%, with the mean at 61.5% The participants showing significant re-growth in the qualitative group (category 2) were 28 of 50, or 56%. In the quantitatively studied group, the number of men with significant re-growth (greater than 100%) was 40 of 98, or 40.8%. These men had hair count increases of 100% or more. The range of hair count increases was 102% to 472%, with a mean increase of 194%. The photograph of these men and women showed significant cosmetic changes which correlates very well with our quantitative findings.</p>
    <p>From the photos taken monthly during the course of the study, a pattern of re-growth was observed in those participants who demonstrated a significant increase in hair counts over the five months. The first countable hairs were seen after 10-12 weeks of treatment and were first detected on the crown or vertex of the head. Following further treatment, hair was then observed re-growing in the thinning or balding areas of the scalp. Hair re-growth in the fronto-temporal region of the scalp was noted after 16-20 weeks of treatment, and this region appeared to be the most resistant to re-growth to date.</p>
    <p>This open-ended study has demonstrated the hair re-growth response of 148 men who have been treated with an all natural compound solution applied topically to balding or thinning regions of the scalp. The treatment program included regular scalp cleansing with a natural extract scalp cleanser and application of at least 5-10 ml of the all natural compound solution at least twice daily. The data showed that hair counts increased significantly for approximately 85% of the participants in the five month period.</p>
    <p>The study methodology implies that the results obtained relate not only to the all natural compound solution used in the treatment, but also the overall treatment regimen. From previous minoxidil (Rogaine) papers, it was determined by them that a reasonable expectation for a &quot;placebo-type&quot; effect was a 10-15% increase in hair counts. Thus, by setting the cut-off in this study for moderate re-growth at a 30% increase, any increase due to a &quot;placebo-type&quot; effect is discounted.</p>
    <p>An attempt was made to correlate the response (either no change, moderate change, or significant change) with a number of factors. None of the factors studied gave a strong correlation, although there were some trends noted. The number of years of balding or thinning hair did not appear to have any correlation with the final results. However, it should be noted that the number of years thinning was a number given by the participants, and could not be verified accurately. Thus it is a subject of assessment and may not be very reliable. To help balance this uncertainty, the results were grouped. Regardless of the groupings used, there was no grouping which demonstrated a significant correlation with results.</p>
    <p>In terms of hair re-growth, this all natural compound solution appears to be more effective than minoxidil (Rogaine) and has no known side effects. A study by Alanis showed that a 2% minoxidil preparation applied topically increased hair counts by about 24% after 20 weeks. This study showed an increase of 89% in the same time period. Because of the differences in locating the measured regions of the scalp, these results are not directly comparable, but in a population study, Alanis's results showed that 34-46 out of 83 participants (48%) had no growth after 24 weeks, whereas our results show only 14 out of 98 (14%) had no growth after 20 weeks.</p>
    <p>Thus, our conclusion is that this product does stimulate re-growth of hair in cases of androgenic alopecia (balding), and that over 85% of men will respond favorably to the treatment. </p>

    <strong>Milk Thistle: Nature&rsquo;s treatment for liver disease </strong>
    <p>Liver disease (including cirrhosis) is one of the most common health problems in older dogs. It can damage all functions of the dog&rsquo;s liver, with very harmful effects on his health. </p>
    <p>Canine Milk Thistle is a highly effective herbal tonic, a well-known treatment for liver disease in both humans and dogs. Interestingly, Milk Thistle is one of the few herbal remedies that has no equivalent in conventional medicine. It effectively treats a wide variety of dog liver diseases, and is also helpful for digestive disorders.</p>
    <p>The active ingredients in Canine Milk Thistle are known collectively as silymarin. These ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displace toxins trying to bind to the dog&rsquo;s liver </li>
        <li>Help the dog&rsquo;s liver to regenerate more quickly </li>
        <li>Scavenge free radicals </li>
        <li>Stabilize liver membranes </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Milk thistle is excellent for use any time your dog is ill, to support his liver and help his recovery. As an anti-oxidant, silymarin is even more effective than vitamin E. It also stimulates the production of new liver cells in dogs, replacing damaged cells.</p>
    <p>Canine Milk Thistle is great for combating the toxic side effects of drugs like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chemotherapy drugs </li>
        <li>Chemical heartworm medications </li>
        <li>Antibiotics </li>
        <li>Corticosteroids </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An all natural, herbal product, milk thistle is safe for long-term use.</p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip; <br /></strong>&ldquo;My dog Bingo has had a bad liver for a while now, probably from polluted water. We tried quite a few things to get him back to health but nothing seemed to work. Our vet is great and does everything he can. We decided to try something that wasn't full of chemicals, so went on the internet looking for a natural supplement. Luckily, we landed on your site and found Milk Thistle. It was within our price range, so we got it. The results were really great. Bingo reacted well to it, his liver condition has gradually improved and he has more energy than he has had for ages!

    <p>&quot;My dog, George is so much better on it. I really think that the Milk Thistle has helped with that immensely. He has never had the appetite that he now has. He is a runt sheltie and I used to have to almost beg him to eat; to hand feed him. He now relishes his meals and loves treats as well. He now is a slim 13 + lbs. Shelties normally weigh between 20 - 25 lbs. He is doing GREAT! I'm so glad I found you online!&quot; <br />Ellen Davis</p>

    <p>Indian Madder: Has a long history of use in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine with records dating back to 206BC-23AD. It was synthesized in 1868. A bittersweet, cooling herb, which reduces inflammation, stimulates the circulation and has antibacterial, astringent, and hypoallergenic properties. Studies show it regulates blood vessel constriction; it may influence vascular flow to areas of skin injury. It is also high in antioxidants, helping reduce free radical damage and inflammation to the skin. Considered one of the best blood purifying herbs in Ayurvedic medicine. It has been used for thousands of years in SE Asia to treat skin infections, ulcers, and skin diseases, including pityriasis versicolor. Contains moisturizing properties.</p>
    <p>Wattle: A herb that has been used in India and Sri Lanka for over 5000 years. It reached Europe in the 17th century and since then has been used extensively by the French perfume industry, for its fragrance, which is said to be superior then that of violets. An aromatic soothing herb that forms a protective coating over inflamed tissue, reducing irritation and encouraging healing. It has stimulating, antiseptic, and astringent properties. It is used on burns to prevent scarring. Its strong anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties contribute to the medicinal uses of the cream.</p>
    <p>Saymplocus Racemosa (Lodh tree): Has anti-inflammatory and vulnerary activity, contributing to skin repair. It is used in anti-wrinkle formulations due to its moisturizing and rejuvenating properties. Internally, it plays a strong role in women's health, being used to treat uterine disorders and menorrhagia.</p>
    <p>Vetiveria Zaizanioides: an aromatic, sedative, antiseptic herb that increases the production of red blood corpuscles. Used externally to remove excess heat from tissues. Thus, it is particularly effective in reducing skin inflammation. It is also antibacterial, which reduces incidence of acne.</p>
    <p>Horsfieldia Irgyhedi: an aromatic flowering herb that has cooling, purifying and healing properties. </p>
    <p>Rosehip seed oil: contains fatty oil, known as gamma linoleic acid, which has been found to regenerate damaged skin. Rose hips are high in Vitamin C and bioflavonoids, both instrumental in connective tissue repair. Rose hips also contain Vitamin E, Vitamin K, riboflavin and folate. It is a wonderfully soothing and natural healing agent and is extremely beneficial for the treatment of dry or fissured skin. </p>
    <p>Vitamin E oil: Is helpful in healing scars and damaged skin. It is also beneficial for antioxidant protection. Vitamin E is incorporated into the lipid portion of cell membranes and carrier molecules and protects these structures from toxic compounds, heavy metals, drugs, radiation and free radicals. Vitamin E also protects cholesterol from oxidative damage. As an antioxidant, Vitamin E may protect against the effects of aging by destroying free radicals, which cause degeneration in tissues such as the skin and blood vessels. </p>
    <p>Sandalwood: Used for over 5000 years in the East it is an astringent herb that cools the body and calms the mind. It has analgesic and antiseptic effects. </p>
    <p>Jasmine: Beneficial for all skin types. Used to increase elasticity of the skin, reduces stretch marks, scars and is an aphrodisiac.</p>

  dosage: |-
    <p><strong>Hair Inhibitors:</strong></p>
    <p>After using your regular method of hair removal, apply either the lotion or spray to the desired area. Make sure your skin is clean before doing this. If you are applying the lotion, massage it into the skin until it is fully absorbed.</p>
    <p>If you are using the spray, apply to desired area and leave until dry. After waiting approximately 15 minutes, apply either the lotion or spray again. Do this once more after another 15 minute interval so that the Kalo product has been applied 3 times after hair removal.</p>
    <p>It is important to apply the Kalo products soon after hair removal for maximum effectiveness. The day after hair removal, apply Kalo three times in the same fashion as stated above. After the second day, wait until your next hair removal session before applying Kalo inhibitors again.</p>
    <p>For maximum results, apply the spray three times, and apply the lotion once the day of hair removal.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingrown Hair Treatment:</strong></p>
    <p>For large areas, spray Ingrown Hair Treatment directly onto affected areas. For smaller and sensitive areas (eyebrow, bikini area) apply with a cotton swab. Massage in thoroughly. Apply immediately after every hair removal and 2-3 times daily until skin clears. If using Kalo Hair Inhibitor (Spray or Lotion) allow 2-3 hours before applying the Kalo Ingrown Hair Treatment.

    <p><strong>Canine Hyperactivity and Stress</strong><br />Is your dog unusually anxious or excitable? Does he drive you crazy with his running around in circles, barking and jumping? Does he show the symptoms below?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive aggression </li>
        <li>Changes in dog&rsquo;s behavior </li>
        <li>Mood problems </li>
        <li>Hyperactivity </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To a degree, these behaviors are to be expected, especially in certain breeds of dogs and with young dogs. But at some point, such symptoms go beyond acceptable levels and enter the realm of canine hyperactivity. </p>
    <p><strong>Canine Separation Anxiety</strong><br />Does your dog exhibit the symptoms below?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distress when you leave him alone </li>
        <li>Scratching at doors or woodwork </li>
        <li>Chewing your clothing (shoes, slippers, etc.) when you&rsquo;re away </li>
        <li>Chewing furniture </li>
        <li>Excessive barking while you&rsquo;re gone </li>
        <li>Soiling the floor even though he&rsquo;s housetrained </li>
        <li>Attempts to escape </li>
        <li>Possible loss of appetite </li>
        <li>Possible loss of interest in activities </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If this sounds familiar, chances are your dog is suffering from canine separation anxiety. It&rsquo;s a common condition in many breeds of dogs. Though it&rsquo;s normal for dogs to miss their masters when they&rsquo;re away, it can be a real problem when obsessive or destructive behaviors result.</p>
    <p><strong>The natural solution for all stress/anxiety disorders in dogs<br /></strong>Canine Lesstress is an all-natural herbal formulation, which very effectively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calms dogs, reducing hyperactivity </li>
        <li>Reduces anxiety, including canine separation anxiety </li>
        <li>Improves a dog&rsquo;s disposition </li>
        <li>Reduces destructive behavior </li>
        <li>Boosts a dog&rsquo;s immune system </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Though Canine Lesstress can definitely help reduce your dog&rsquo;s anxiety levels, it&rsquo;s even more effective when used in combination with behavioral conditioning and lifestyle changes. Here are some hints for treating canine separation anxiety:</p>
    <p>Take your dog for a walk before leaving him alone. This way, he&rsquo;ll learn to associate your departure with a positive activity.</p>
    <p>Exercise also has the benefit of making it easier for your dog to sleep while you&rsquo;re away. If possible, start by only being away from your dog for short periods. Then gradually increase your time away. His confidence should gradually increase as he learns that you always come back.</p>

    <p><strong>Conquer Low Libido &ndash; With The Ultimate Combination of Male Aphrodisiacs</strong></p>
    <p>Impotence affects a significant number of men in North America and the developed world, especially if you take into account the number of men asking their doctors for Viagra. Impotence is the failure of a man to achieve and maintain an erection. There may be psychological reasons for impotence and these should be investigated. But the major cause is often damage to the blood vessels that supply blood to the penis. The male erection is a result of increased blood flow to the penis, and if blood cannot reach the penis in sufficient amounts, due to vascular disease, then an erection does not occur.</p>

    <p><strong>What is Canine Diabetes Mellitus?</strong></p>
    <p>Diabetes results when the dog&rsquo;s pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. Sugars build up in the bloodstream rather than enter the body&rsquo;s tissues where they would otherwise provide energy. (This is why diabetic dogs are often lethargic.) <br />Excess sugar in a dog&rsquo;s bloodstream can lead to several of other conditions, including heart, liver and kidney disease, increased infections, slow healing, cataracts, blindness, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Risk factors </strong>for dog diabetes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Obesity </li>
        <li>Poor diet </li>
        <li>Cortisone treatments </li>
        <li>Genetic predisposition </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Diabetes is more common in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Female dogs </li>
        <li>Overweight dogs </li>
        <li>Middle-aged and older dogs </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Common Symptoms</strong> of Dog Diabetes Mellitus include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Increased thirst, frequent urination </li>
        <li>Weakness, lethargy </li>
        <li>Signs of pain in the abdomen </li>
        <li>Cataracts (eyes cloudy rather than clear) </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Diagnosing and treating Dog Diabetes</strong></p>
    <p>If you think your dog might have diabetes, you should take him to a vet. A veterinarian can diagnose dog diabetes mellitus by examining sugar levels in the dog&rsquo;s blood or urine. </p>
    <p>Treatment includes a healthy diet, high in fiber and complex carbohydrates. You should feed your dog in small amounts, several times a day, to help his body stabilize insulin levels. If your dog is overweight, you should help him lose weight through diet and increased exercise. Conventional treatment may also include regular injections of insulin.</p>
    <p><strong>Can herbal remedies help treat dog diabetes?</strong></p>
    <p>Many studies have indicated that the right combination of herbal extracts &ndash; such as those in Canine Mellit &ndash; can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevent dog diabetes from developing, and </li>
        <li>Keep it under control in dogs that already have it </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The herbs in Canine Mellit act directly on blood sugar levels to help control dog diabetes. It is highly effective when used alone, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program.</p>
    <p>Canine Mellit is completely healthy and natural, without harsh chemicals. It is safe for long-term use. This is a very popular product for one reason: it works! </p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;My dog Jake is getting on in years, to put it mildly. Not long ago, he was diagnosed with diabetes. I did not want to get into insulin injections, so my vet recommended I put him on a diet and try a natural supplement. Am I ever glad I did. Jake is now acting like he did five years ago!&quot; Mike, Cornwall Ont.</p>

    <p>&quot;I wanted to tell you that our little Ellie is doing great on your Mellit product. After finding out that she had diabetes we got really frustrated. Although she is little, she is a squirmer and a fighter. My husband and I had a hard time giving her the insulin shots. The trapping for shots also made her very leery of us and it was upsetting that our little girl was afraid of us.</p>
    <p>We found your product on the computer and after talking to a nice girl on the phone decided to try it. Ellie has been taking Mellit for three months now and is doing well. We have stopped her insulin shots and she is now comes up to us for cuddles again. We had her tested after four weeks like the girl on the phone told us and the product is really doing its job. Thank you,&quot;<br />Heidi and James, California</p>

    <p><strong>What is Feline Diabetes Mellitus?</strong></p>
    <p>Diabetes is caused by the failure of the pancreas to release enough insulin into the bloodstream. Without sufficient insulin, sugars build up rather than enter the body&rsquo;s tissues where they provide energy. (This is why diabetic cats tend to be lethargic.) </p>
    <p>This build up of sugar in the bloodstream can lead to a host of other conditions, including liver, kidney and heart disease, increased infections, slow healing, eye problems, etc.</p>

    <strong>What is Canine Arthritis?</strong><br />Osteoarthritis can occur in any joint, and usually affects older dogs. Arthritis technically means &quot;inflammation of the joint&quot;. Inflammation is characterized by swelling, stiffness, and pain. It can be either hereditary or caused by disease, poor nutrition, or congenital abnormalities. In dogs, the joints commonly affected with arthritis are the knee, shoulder, elbow, ankle, and most commonly, the hips.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Warning signs that your dog is suffering from arthritis include a reluctance to stand up or climb stairs. Other telltale signs of canine arthritis include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your dog favors one side of his body </li>
        <li>Limping, especially when he first gets up </li>
        <li>Swollen joints (especially the hips) </li>
        <li>Reduced appetite </li>
        <li>Aversion to being touched or petted </li>
        <li>Your dog loses interest in activities he previously enjoyed: running, swimming, playing, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Large breeds of dogs tend to suffer from arthritis more often than smaller breeds. This is probably due simply to the extra weight and stress on the joints of larger breeds.</p>

    <p>Note: This product is not a hair loss treatment. It is simply designed for fast hair growth. For hair loss treatments, please see our <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/hair-growth-p34.cfm">Hair Essentials</a>, and <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/anti-dht-hair-loss-treatment-p30.cfm">Revivogen</a> products.</p>
    <p><strong>Why Would I Want Faster Hair Growth?</strong></p>
    <p>Many women dread getting their hair cut because it takes too long to grow back. With F.A.S.T., you do not have to worry about your hair taking another year to return to the length you want.</p>
    <p>When growing your hair out, you don't have to slowly suffer through those &quot;awkward length&quot; stages. Use FAST to increase the rate of growth, and get the hair length you&rsquo;ve always wanted, faster!</p>
    <p><strong>About Hair Growth</strong></p>
    <p>There are three steps in hair growth. The first is anagen, which is the growth stage of the hair growth cycle. During this stage protein and keratin are produced continually for 4 to 6 years. Anagen hair represents 90% of the hair on your head at any given time.</p>
    <p>The second stage is catagen, the transitional stage. This is when hair stops growing, and lasts 2 to 3 weeks.</p>
    <p>The third and final stage is called telogen, the resting stage. During this stage the hair sits on the head waiting to fall out. Once it does, a new budding hair is ready to replace it as the anagen stage of hair growth begins.</p>
    <p><strong>Ways to help stimulate hair growth</strong></p>
    <p>A balanced diet rich in amino acids and B vitamins will contribute to a healthy head of hair. Because hair is dead protein, a diet high in protein will also be beneficial. Vitamins and foods such as vitamin B, folic acid, magnesium, calves liver, eggs, fish, yogurt, soy protein, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, and beta-carotene should be included in your diet for healthy hair. Beta-carotene is turned into vitamin A and can be found in yellow and green fruits and vegetables.</p>
    <p>It is also suggested that you cut back on fat, caffeine, carbonated beverages, sugar, smoking, and use of hot water and hot blow dryers. Make sure to get plenty of rest and moderate exercise. These steps are not only vital for healthy hair, but for a healthy life style as well.</p>
    <p><strong>Some other remedies for hair growth are:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stimulate hair follicles with weekly scalp massages. </li>
        <li>Hot oil treatments to help protect the scalp from damage of styling devices and sun. </li>
        <li>A healthy diet rich in amino acids and B vitamins </li>
        <li>Exercise and a sufficient amount of sleep </li>
        <li>Treat your hair as delicately as possible </li>
        <li>Note: cutting your hair does not stimulate hair growth. It simply gets rid of spliced ends. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Hair Facts</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>On average, hair grows &frac12;&quot; per month; 6&quot; per year </li>

            </strong></font>Canine allergies are the most common ailments affecting 
            pets, due to changed lifestyles (including food) and environment. Dog 
            allergies are the body's abnormal reaction to stimuli caused by many different 
            factors. Allergic reactions can be different from one organism to another, 
            even for the same allergen (agent). Sometimes, these allergens are in 
            ones own body, causing the body to react against itself (e.g. auto-immune 
            diseases). It is important to try to find the cause for dog allergies, 
            even though it is not easy. Along with working towards finding the cause, 
            the use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms, and also to improve 
            the immune system.

    <p>How many times does your cat try and drink from the faucet or how many dogs love to drink from the garden hose?  In nature, moving water is much   fresher than stagnant water. The movement constantly breaks the surface tension   of the water and draws oxygen from the air into the water. This process is   called aeration and it makes water more appealing to drink. Pets may be drawn by   instinct to moving water for this reason. </p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Pet Fountain filters and aerates continuously moving water to keep it much fresher than   standing bowl water. Even pets who don't jump on   counters to drink from faucets may drink more water using the Fountain. </p>
    <p>Why is   this important? Many cats and dogs may not drink as much water as they should. This is one reason   the urine becomes so concentrated and predisposes some pets to urinary tract   disease, constipation or kidney disease. In particular, cats with urinary tract or kidney disease have a critical need for   water to support kidney function or prevent crystal formation and obstruction. </p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Pet Fountain is veterinarian designed and recommended by vet urinary specialists. It encourages water intake and proper hydration in healthy pets, and is especially   beneficial in pets with kidney or urinary tract disease.</p>
    <p><strong>Health Benefits </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves your pet's   health </li>
        <li>Reduces urinary diseases </li>
        <li>Improves the quality of   your pet's life </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using a 5-inch falling   stream of water, the Pet Fountain continually aerates your pet's water with   healthful oxygen. A charcoal filter also removes bad tastes and odors, giving   your pet the best possible - and most appealing - way to stay hydrated! </p>
    <strong>Features Of The Fountain </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides pets with an   enjoyable &quot;falling stream&quot; of water </li>
        <li>Removes bad tastes and   odors with extra large charcoal filter </li>
        <li>Adds more oxygen for   freshness </li>
        <li>Easy to maintain </li>
        <li>Helps keep cats off   counters and out of sinks </li>
        <li>Patented free falling   system </li>

    <p><strong>Testimonials<br /> </strong>We have a 104-lbs. female Rottweiler who loves to drink fresh water. She was   spoiled as a baby; we used to let her jump in the bathroom tub for drinks! As   you can imagine, giving her drinks from the tub each time she jumped in and   barked (quite loudly) if you didn't pay attention to her request, got old! She   loves your fountain and adapted right to it. I wish we would have had your   fountain years ago when we had two large male Rotties. They would have loved it! <br />   <em>Valerie, CO </em></p>
    <p>I purchased the Drinkwell Pet Fountain and it is now the only thing my three   cats will drink out of. I purchased it because one of my cats had severe kidney   failure and it has drastically improved his health and quality of life. It has   also stopped my other cat from jumping on the counter and crying for me to turn   the sink on. We love the Drinkwell and would recommend it to everyone. <br />     <em>John &amp; Cassandra, Maryland</em></p>
    <p>Upon opening the package, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the   product. It is well-made, sturdy and odorless. I was really impressed! Kaz is   prone to urinary tract infections but now she won't get dehydrated! As far as   I'm concerned, you have attained PURRFECTION in this imperfect world. <br />   <em>Judy</em>, Alabama</p>

    <p><strong>What is cat diarrhea?</strong><br />Diarrhea is how your cat's body protects itself from toxins she&rsquo;s ingested. Food is forced to pass through her system quickly. Liquids are expelled before her digestive tract has a chance to absorb them, which is what causes both the liquid feces and dehydration.</p>
    <p>Cat diarrhea is a very common problem and has many causes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mild food poisoning from eating spoiled food </li>
        <li>Changes in diet </li>
        <li>Viral infections </li>
        <li>Parasites </li>
        <li>Stress </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In many cases, the cat simply has a very sensitive stomach, or is reacting to stressful events such as a changed environment.</p>
    <p><strong>Treating cat diarrhea</strong></p>
    <p>If your cat gets diarrhea, here&rsquo;s what to do:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to figure out what caused your cat&rsquo;s diarrhea. If she's eaten something toxic, get her to a vet immediately. If you think it was caused by a change in diet, put your cat back on her former diet. </li>
        <li>Ensure your cat is drinking lots of water, to fight off dehydration. </li>
        <li>Get an effective, healthy natural remedy like Feline Plantaeris. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Feline Plantaeris, one of our best-loved products, very effectively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regulates your cat's intestinal functions </li>
        <li>Helps her heal </li>
        <li>Boosts her immune system </li>
        <li>Improves overall health </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can be confident giving Plantaeris to even the most sensitive cats. It is: </p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong><br />&quot;When your cat gets diarrhea, it really can be a stressful time. I know this first hand as two months ago my cat Buffy had a really bad bout. The poor little thing was depressed for days until I got the Plantaeris product I ordered from you. Of course, I made sure that I gave Buffy a good diet too but when I coupled that with the Plantaeris remedy, her diarrhea got better in no time. Since this incident, I always keep it handy but, touch wood, Buffy has been diarrhea free ever since. Excellent product. Thank you all.&quot; <br />Alex - Huntington, NY</p>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;Thank you for making Plantaeris! We have two cats, and one of them has a very delicate stomach. It's like she'll get diarrhea just from LOOKING at some foods. I started using Plantaeris on her a few months ago, and she hasn't had any real bouts of diarrhea since. I'm amazed and very happy!&quot;<br />Connie - Cleveland</p>

    <p><strong>Testimonia<font color="#800000">l</font></strong><br />&quot;My cat Hillary is a delight in every way... except that she's always been prone to getting diarrhea! We lived with this problem for years (off and on, of course) until a friend recommended your diarrhea medicine. We tried it, and are we ever glad we did! Whenever Hillary starts getting diarrhea, we put her on Plantaeris and she's better in no time. She doesn't mind taking it, either. Maybe she knows it's good for her? Anyway, I just wanted to let you know how pleased we are.&quot;<br />Jenna - Lakeview CA</p>
    <p><strong>More Testimonials</strong><br />&quot;We tried for months to find something to help Woosie with her digestive system and constant diarrhea, after trying all of the vet medications, we found you on the internet and figured it was a last chance. Woosie not only recovered quickly under the Plantaeris formula, she enjoys it, and that says allot for cats and medicines. It has helped immensely for us and Woosie, she no longer suffers the pain and embarrassment of incontinence, and we are no longer cleaning up after her when she couldn't make it to the litter box. We thank you!&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;This product is amazing!! I can't thank you enough!&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Katie has had chronic diarrhea since she i got her at 6 weeks old. I took her to the vet and he gave her antibiotics and tested her but could not find anything wrong with her. I fed her science diet id for her condition and she still has the problem. Then a friend saw your web site and told me about it. I started giving her Plantaeris and I could not believe it!!!! She does not have diarrhea when I give her this in her wet food. I also have Molly who has an allergy problem and loses the hair on her tummy and back legs. I started giving her stimmune and she now has a full body of hair on her whole body. her hair is shiny and thick. I love your products.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;My cat was dying and down to 3 lbs. He had taken SO much Tapazole, his last blood test shows his thyroid is normal and good. <strong>The diarrhea stopped immediately upon the first dose of the plantaeris medicine</strong>. his movements have become firm and just a few a day. He is eating really well and trying to gain some weight back. thanks you so much... I am recommended your products to any and all.&quot;</p>

    <p><strong><br /> </strong><strong>Keeping cats agile, comfortable and pain free - Naturally.</strong><br /> A variety of natural nutrients help to keep your cat active and pain free. The   cornerstone nutrients, Glucosamine HCL and Chondroitin Sulfate, have   demonstrated great success in naturally conditioning joints an enhancing   comfort. Secondary nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium and zinc have   been added for their co-factor benefits to assist in the effectiveness of   Glucosamine and Chondroitin.<br /> <br />   <strong>Hips and Joints get damaged over time</strong><br />   In   normal joints the tips of the bones are soft and spongy and are floating in a   gel-like fluid which acts as a cushion, keeping bone from touching bone. As cats   age, or if they exercise a lot, that cushion gets thinner and thinner. When the   bones get close enough, or touch, the result is pain and discomfort which   results in loss of mobility and stiffness. That's where Glucosamine HCL and Chondroitin come into   play. These nutrients help condition and rebuild worn, aching joints.<br />   <br />   <strong>Easy Feeding, Delicious and Low   in Fat</strong><br />   The conditioning nutrients in Hip   Action are mixed into a scrumptious, all-natural treat. The Hip Action formula   begins with real chicken and is followed by spelt, soy, malted barley, tapioca,   and fish oil. Glucosamine, Chondriotin and essential vitamins and minerals are   then added to complete this tasty treat. Hip Action contains NO wheat, corn,   artificial colors, flavors, BHA, added tallow or by-products. It's the   all-natural, delicious, easy-to-feed solution for your cat.<br />   <br />   <strong>Getting Results, Hip Action Morsels will   benefit most cats.</strong><br />   The degree of discomfort varies from cat to cat as does the ability to provide   relief. Increased comfort is typically achieved in 4 to 6 weeks of daily   feeding. Owners are urged to pay close attention to their cat's condition   because improvement in agility is gradual. Getting the desired results may   involve varying the amounts that are fed daily. See feeding instructions. Once   the right amount has been established, cats can remain mobile and happy.</p>
    <p><strong>Customer Testimonial</strong><br /> Hello,<br /> We just adopted our 2nd persian (both rescued from kitten mills). She's about 5   and spent most of her life in a cage. She was so timid &amp; spent her first   week in hiding...until I brought home a package of Zuke's Purrz! As soon as I   opened the package and got closer, she crawled out to get a sniff... We left a   trail all the way to a sunny window/open area. She inhaled every one. In the   last 3 weeks we started hiding them around the house &amp; she loves discovering   where they are hidden! Now both cats gently approach and put a paw on our   arm...Purrz please!! Great product! Sincerely, Mikey (2years) &amp; Dharma (3   years) thank you from the bottom of their heart (stomach!)</p>

    <p><strong>How Does The Fountain Increase My Pets Water Intake?</strong><br />  How many times does your cat try and drink from the faucet or how many dogs love to drink from the garden hose?  In nature, moving water is much fresher than stagnant water. The movement constantly breaks the surface tension of the water and draws oxygen from the air into the water. This process is called aeration and it makes water more appealing to drink. Pets may be drawn by instinct to moving water for this reason.</p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Pet Fountain filters and aerates continuously moving water to keep it much fresher than standing bowl water. Even pets who don't jump on counters to drink from faucets may drink more water using the Fountain.</p>
    <p>Why is this important? Many cats and dogs may not drink as much water as they should. This is one reason the urine becomes so concentrated and predisposes some pets to urinary tract   disease, constipation or kidney disease. In particular, cats with urinary tract or kidney disease have a critical need for water to support kidney function or prevent crystal formation and obstruction.</p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Pet Fountain is veterinarian designed and recommended by vet urinary specialists. It encourages water intake and proper hydration in healthy pets, and is especially beneficial in pets with kidney or urinary tract disease.</p>
    <p><strong>Health Benefits</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves your pet's health </li>
        <li>Reduces urinary diseases </li>
        <li>Improves the quality of your pet's life </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's simple, safe and proven to benefit your pet's health.. Research shows that one of the best ways to improve your pet's health is to get them to drink more water. And the best way to do that is with the Drinkwell Pet Fountain. By using a 5-inch falling stream of water, the Pet Fountain continually aerates your pet's water with healthful oxygen. A charcoal filter also removes bad tastes and odors, giving your pet the best possible - and most appealing - way to stay hydrated! </p>
    <p><strong>Features Of The Fountain </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides pets with an enjoyable &quot;falling stream&quot; of water</li>
        <li>Removes bad tastes and odors with extra large charcoal filter</li>
        <li>Adds more oxygen for freshness</li>
        <li>Easy to maintain</li>

    <p><strong>Testimonials</strong><br /> &quot;Upon opening the package, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the product. It is well-made, sturdy and odorless. I was really impressed! Kaz is prone to urinary tract infections but now she won't get dehydrated! As far as I'm concerned, you have attained PURRFECTION in this imperfect world.&quot;<br /> <em>Judy, Alabama</em></p>
    <p>&quot;I purchased the Drinkwell Pet Fountain and it is now the only thing my three cats will drink out of. I purchased it because one of my cats had severe kidney failure and it has drastically improved his health and quality of life. It has also stopped my other cat from jumping on the counter and crying for me to turn   the sink on. We love the Drinkwell and would recommend it to everyone.&quot;<br /> <em>John &amp; Cassandra, Maryland</em></p>
    <p>&quot;After a painful experience with UTI and bladder crystals, our vet told us our kitty would need to be fed prescription diet for the rest of his life. What a bummer. We heard about the Drinkwell Pet Fountain and invested in it for our kitty's health. Our kitty started drinking copious amounts of water, no prescription diet necessary! I am now a big advocate. Who would want to drink out of a dirty, stagnant bowl anyway? The filtered, aerated water from the Drinkwell is fresh and great.&quot;<br /> <em>Caleb, California</em></p>

            </strong></font>Mineral deposits and stone formation (urinary calculi) 
            in the urinary tract are a common dog problem indicating canine kidney 
            failure. Stones cause bladder-lining irritation; if their diameter is 
            big enough, they can cause partial or complete urinary obstruction. Poor 
            diet is one cause of this condition; pets that ingest only dry food, or 
            have excessive mineral content in the diet are supposedly more susceptible 
            to the problem. Specific types of dog breeds also have a tendency to get 
            it. Changes in the diet should be implemented immediately; liquids should 
            be increased to help avoid mineral deposit, and sodium intake should be 
            reduced. Too much sodium increases heart rate which is linked with kidney 
            disease. The use of herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms of kidney 
            disease in dogs, relieving pain and avoiding infections.

    <p><strong>How Does The Fountain Increase My Pets Water Intake?</strong><br />  How many times does your cat try and drink from the faucet or how many dogs love to drink from the garden hose?  In nature, moving water is much   fresher than stagnant water. The movement constantly breaks the surface tension   of the water and draws oxygen from the air into the water. This process is   called aeration and it makes water more appealing to drink. Pets may be drawn by   instinct to moving water for this reason. </p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Big-Dog Fountain filters and aerates continuously moving water to keep it much fresher than   standing bowl water. Even pets who don't jump on   counters to drink from faucets may drink more water using the Fountain. </p>
    <p>Why is   this important? Many cats and dogs may not drink as much water as they should. This is one reason   the urine becomes so concentrated and predisposes some pets to urinary tract   disease, constipation or kidney disease. In particular, cats with urinary tract or kidney disease have a critical need for   water to support kidney function or prevent crystal formation and obstruction. </p>
    <p>The Drinkwell Big-Dog Fountain is veterinarian designed and recommended by vet urinary specialists. It encourages water intake and proper hydration in healthy pets, and is especially   beneficial in pets with kidney or urinary tract disease.</p>
    <p><strong>Health Benefits</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves your pet's health </li>
        <li>Reduces urinary diseases</li>
        <li>Improves the quality of your pet's life</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using a 5-inch falling stream of water, the Drinkwell Big-Dog Fountain continually aerates your pet's water with   healthful oxygen. A charcoal filter also removes bad tastes and odors, giving   your pet the best possible - and most appealing - way to stay hydrated!</p>
    <strong>Features Of The Fountain </strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides pets with an   enjoyable &quot;falling stream&quot; of water </li>
        <li>Removes bad tastes and odors with extra large charcoal filter</li>
        <li>Adds more oxygen for freshness</li>
        <li>Easy to maintain</li>
        <li>Helps keep cats off counters and out of sinks</li>
        <li>Patented free falling system</li>

    <p><strong>Testimonials<br /> </strong>We have a 104-lbs. female Rottweiler who loves to drink fresh water. She was spoiled as a baby; we used to let her jump in the bathroom tub for drinks! As   you can imagine, giving her drinks from the tub each time she jumped in and   barked (quite loudly) if you didn't pay attention to her request, got old! She loves your fountain and adapted right to it. I wish we would have had your fountain years ago when we had two large male Rotties. They would have loved it! <br />   <em>Valerie, CO </em></p>
    <p>I purchased the Drinkwell Pet Fountain and it is now the only thing my three cats will drink out of. I purchased it because one of my cats had severe kidney   failure and it has drastically improved his health and quality of life. It has   also stopped my other cat from jumping on the counter and crying for me to turn   the sink on. We love the Drinkwell and would recommend it to everyone. <br />     <em>John &amp; Cassandra, Maryland</em></p>
    <p>Upon opening the package, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the product. It is well-made, sturdy and odorless. I was really impressed! Kaz is prone to urinary tract infections but now she won't get dehydrated! As far as I'm concerned, you have attained PURRFECTION in this imperfect world. <br />   <em>Judy</em>, Alabama</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dog diarrhea</span> is a very common problem, and has many causes. Often, it's a result of mild food poisoning from eating garbage (or other bacteria-filled treasures your dog has found while off leash).</p>
    <p><strong>What to do right away</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Try to figure out what caused your dog's diarrhea. If he's eaten something highly toxic, get him to a vet immediately. </li>
        <li>Ensure your dog is taking in fluids, to fight off dehydration. </li>
        <li>Get a healthy, effective remedy like Canine Plantaeris. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Canine Plantaeris is among our most popular products, for good reason: it works!</p>

    <p><strong>What is dog diarrhea?<br /></strong>Diarrhea &ndash; the frequent and urgent passage of liquid stools &ndash; is how your dog's body protects itself from ingested toxins. Food is forced to pass through his system quickly. Liquids are expelled before the colon has a chance to absorb them, which is what causes both the liquid feces and dehydration.</p>
    <p>If your dog has diarrhea, it will be all-too obvious. Symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loose, liquid and frequent bowel movements </li>
        <li>Mucous in dog's stools </li>
        <li>Possible blood in dog's stools </li>
        <li>Possible dehydration </li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Testimonial</strong><br />&quot;My dog&rsquo;s diarrhea was making our lives miserable. We tried changing his diet, we tried some medication the vet sold us but nothing worked.

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">More Testimonials</span><br />&quot;Hello, I felt I just had to write to you regarding Plantaeris. I got this for my Pomeranian puppy who has had chronic diarrhea ever since we got her at 10 weeks of age--(She is now 10 months old). I have tried prescription meds, home remedies, digestive enzymes, and even resorted to buying the most expensive organic, raw dog food I could find but nothing has worked. I am thrilled to report that Plantaeris is our answer! We started her on it about 2 weeks ago and her stool is already very close to being normal. She also now has the ability to wait to go outside--I can't tell you how happy I am that our puppy is healthier and we don't have to deal with the clean-up issue any longer! THANK YOU!!!!&quot;<br />Heidi, Philadelphia, PA</p>
    <p>&quot;wonderful........after first dosage, within an hour, she felt alot better. Its happened twice so far where nothing else worked but this product.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;THE PLANTARIS WAS ABIG HELP IN GETTING IT UNDER CONTROL - DOESN'T EVEN NEED IT EVERYDAY NOW!!&quot;</p>

    <p><strong>Prosta Care &ndash; For a Healthy Prostate, Naturally </strong></p>
    <p>The prostate is a walnut sized gland located between the bladder and penis. It surrounds the urethra and is in front of the rectum. It produces some of the semen that helps sperm exit the penis as a man ejaculates. Because the urethra runs through the prostate, once the prostate begins to grow, it starts to squeeze the urethra, causing the symptoms of BPH.</p>
    <p>BPH can stand for two ailments. The first is Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, which is the increased number of cells in the prostate. The second is Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy, which is the increased size of the prostate.</p>
    <p>An enlarged prostate usually affects men after 60 years of age. Symptoms include frequent urination, especially at night, a weak stop-start stream, or trouble starting the stream. When a prostate starts to grow, it grows in two ways. The first way is when cells multiply around the urine passageway through the prostate. The second way is a middle lobe growth in which cells grow into the urine tube and up into the bladder. The cause of these growths is a byproduct of the hormone testosterone, called DHT. This blockage of the urethra can cause urinary tract infections, a sudden inability to urinate, or gradual bladder or kidney damage.</p>
    <p>There are two common tests administrated to check up on your prostate&rsquo;s health. The first is a Digital Rectal Exam (DRE). In this case a lubricated, gloved finger is inserted into the rectum to feel for the size and any abnormalities of the prostate. The second test is the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), which is taken to check for prostate cancer and possibly rule it out as a cause for urinary complications. This is a blood test for PSA, which can be found in elevated levels when a man has a prostate cancer. Because all men are different, no single treatment can be recommended to treat BPH.</p>

    <P>Cancer accounts for up to half of the death of pets over 10 years of \r\n        age. If you are not sure if your pet has cancer, here are some common \r\n        symptoms: \r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li> Weight loss or loss of appetite \r\n        <li> Stiffness, loss of stamina, difficulty breathing \r\n        <li> Bleeding or discharge from any body opening or sores that do not \r\n          heal \r\n        <li> Foul odor \r\n        <li> Abnormal swelling that increases in size and does not go away \r\n        <li> Difficulty urinating or defecating\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <P>There are also several types of cancers that you should be aware of. \r\n        Skin cancer is very common in older dogs. However, most skin tumors found \r\n        in dogs are benign. Breast tumors in dogs are also common, but more dangerous. \r\n        Fifty percent \\of all breast tumors in dogs are malignant. Spaying your \r\n        pet between 6 and 12 months of age will help reduce the risk of breast \r\n        cancer. Mouth cancer is more common in dogs than in cats. Symptoms to \r\n        be aware of are foul odor, swelling or bleeding in the nasal cavity, and \r\n        difficulty eating. Other cancers to be aware of are lymphoma, skin and \r\n        abdominal tumors, bone tumors and testicle tumors. \r\n      <p><strong><font color=\"006666\">Ingredients</font></strong><br>\r\n        Burdock: Considered one of the best herbs to use as a nutritive liver \r\n        tonic, that helps clean the blood.

It is also used in treating, arthritis, rheumatoid disorders, \r\n        inflammatory kidney and bladder disorders.</p>\r\n      <p>Sheep\xE2\x80\x99s sorrel: Astringent qualities in treating hemorrhages of \r\n        the stomach.

    <p><strong>How often should I change the filter? </strong><br />Filters should be changed approximately every six to eight weeks for cats and four to six weeks for large dogs. Replace filters more frequently when using the fountain for multiple dogs and dogs that produce a lot of saliva. </p>
    <p><strong>Does the Drinkwell Big Dog Fountain use the same filter as the Original Drinkwell Pet Fountain?</strong><br />Yes, both fountains use the same filter.</p>
    <p><strong>How do I get rid of the charcoal dust in the bowl? </strong><br />Rinse the filter in cold water. Even after rinsing, you will still have remnants of charcoal dust settling in the bottom of the bowl. This dust will eventually dissipate after a few cycles. The charcoal is completely harmless. Even as the dust settles in the bowl, it continues to work by absorbing bad tastes and odors and purifying the water. If you are uncomfortable with the amount of charcoal from the filer, you can remove it. The fountain will function without it.</p>

    <p><strong>Treating coughs and respiratory problems in dogs</strong></p>
    <p>Does your dog cough persistently, or have trouble breathing? It's likely he's suffering from kennel cough or a similar respiratory ailment.</p>
    <p>Canine Respiratory Aid is an all-natural antibiotic, anti-inflammatory formulation. It safely yet effectively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Soothes your dog's cough </li>
        <li>Offers relief from respiratory conditions </li>
        <li>Reduces breathing problems in short-nosed breeds </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A dog's cough is never an illness in itself. Rather, it's a symptom of some other problem, like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allergies </li>
        <li>Asthma </li>
        <li>Bronchitis </li>
        <li>Dog collar too tight </li>
        <li>Irritants like cigarette smoke </li>
        <li>Infectious disease (usually kennel cough) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whatever the cause of your dog&rsquo;s cough or breathing problems, Canine Respiratory Aid offers quick and safe relief.</p>
    <p><strong>What is kennel cough?</strong></p>
    <p>Many dogs suffer from kennel cough. This canine respiratory ailment is a highly contagious condition which &ndash; as its name implies &ndash; is common among dogs that spend a lot of time in close quarters: in kennels, dog shows, grooming salons, etc. Beyond causing respiratory problems, kennel cough can weaken your dog's immune system and make him more prone to catching other canine diseases.</p>
    <p>You can help your dog avoid catching kennel cough (or other canine respiratory diseases) by not letting him share toys, food or water with other, unknown dogs. But if he does catch kennel cough, Canine Respiratory Aid will help ease the symptoms and help him fight the infection.</p>

    <p>My bulldog, Ruff, has always had breathing problems. Then to make matters worse, he picked up Kennel Cough at the doggie daycare. It was just awful listening to him struggle, but I didn&rsquo;t want to put him on drugs. I tried your product instead&hellip; and I&rsquo;m amazed at how well and how quickly it worked. Ruff and I are much happier now. Thanks!! <em>Camille H, Fort Lee NJ</em></p>

    <p>&quot;I am writing to tell you what a great product Respiratory Aid is. When my dog Hutch started to cough a little, I did not really think much of it. Days later, he was coughing up a bit of discharge and his eyes were a bit runny. I did a little bit of research online and decided that Respiratory Aid was the product I was going to try. I am so glad that I did, and so is Hutch! Since he started taking this natural product, his cough is much better and he just seems more alive. Respiratory Aid is great!&quot; Shannon - Seattle, WA</p>

    <p><strong>What is Cholesterol? </strong></p>
    <p>Cholesterol is a lipid (fatty substance) found in animal tissues. It is produced in the liver and circulates throughout the body via the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>A certain level of cholesterol is necessary to maintain normal body functions, but excessive levels can prevent the blood from flowing freely, resulting in serious health problems. </p>
    <p>A given person&rsquo;s cholesterol levels are determined partly by genetics, and partly by lifestyle and diet. The more cholesterol we consume in our diets, the more cholesterol our livers produce.</p>
    <p>Cholesterol is found only in animal-based foods (meat, eggs &amp; dairy). Fruits and vegetables &ndash; including vegetable oils &ndash; do not contain cholesterol. </p>
    <p>Our bodies make two types of cholesterol:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>LDL (the &ldquo;bad&rdquo;) </li>
        <li>HDL (the &ldquo;good&rdquo;) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have built-in systems to regulate and balance the levels of both forms of cholesterol. However, a fatty diet can throw cholesterol levels so far out of balance that the body can&rsquo;t cope. When this happens, extra help (either through prescription drugs or natural herbs) is necessary to achieve healthy cholesterol levels. </p>
    <p><strong>Achieving healthy cholesterol levels without drugs</strong></p>
    <p>There are several things you can do to help your body maintain healthy cholesterol levels:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eat a healthy, balanced diet. (Less fatty meats; more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and beans.) </li>
        <li>Exercise regularly. (You don&rsquo;t have to run marathons or become a yoga master. Simply taking a twenty-minute walk, three times a week will help.) </li>
        <li>Maintain a healthy body weight. </li>
        <li>Supplement your diet with Chol-Lite </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>What is Chol-Lite?</strong></p>
    <p>There are now many published clinical studies proving that certain herbs are extremely effective in supporting the cardiovascular system and promoting healthy cholesterol levels.<br /><br />Chol-Lite is a unique combination of such herbs. Painstakingly-developed by a leading naturopathic doctor, it is the most effective natural cholesterol-management product on the market. </p>
    <p>By helping the liver and cardiovascular system perform their jobs more effectively, Chol-Lite helps the body balance cholesterol levels naturally. </p>
    <p>Chol-Lite is a 100% natural product. Even the capsules it comes in are vegetable- based. It contains no harsh chemicals and causes no harmful side effects. In fact, Chol-Lite is an excellent general tonic. </p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;My doctor gave me the green light to try Chol-Lite. I've been taking it for six months now and can really say it works great, with no side effects! God bless you for all your help and advice.&quot;<br />-- Susan, Sacramento CA</p>
    <p>&quot;After having mixed experiences with prescription drugs, I decided to try a natural remedy to manage my cholesterol. A Google search revealed that Chol-Lite came highly recommended, so I decided to give it a try. I just a few months, I couldn't believe the difference, and neither could my doctor. Based on your advice, I'm going to keep taking Chol-Lite, watch my diet, and exercise. Thanks for making this great product available&quot;<br />-- Pat, Hoboken NJ</p>
    <p>&quot;I've long believed in natural remedies, and my doctor agreed to let me try Chol-Lite. In just over a month, there was an improvement. After three months, I felt GREAT! I&rsquo;d recommend Chol-Lite to anyone looking for an effective and natural way to manage their cholesterol.&rdquo;<br />-- Sammy, Vancouver BC</p>

    <p><strong>About Warts</strong></p>
    <p>Warts are benign tumors that can grow on any part of the body. There are at least 100 different types that have been identified by scientists. These are caused by the human papillama virus (HPV) and can be passed by direct contact with the affected area, or by using the same objects as those who have warts (ex. towels). They can be passed during sexual intercourse. Those with genital warts don&rsquo;t always know they have the virus, as warts are not always present or visible.</p>
    <p>There are four main types of warts: common, flat, plantar and genital. Common warts can grow on fingers, around the nails and on the backs of the hands. They usually grow where the skin is broken. Those who bite their nails or pick their hangnails are often afflicted with common warts.</p>
    <p>Flat warts grow on the hands and face. They are raised and roughly textured. The color may vary from pink to brown and vary in size from pin sized to a large mass. They are found where the skin has been damaged or traumatized in some way.</p>
    <p>Plantar warts tend to be hard and flat with a rough surface. Since they usually grow on the bottom on the feet, the pressure of walking and standing pushes them deeper into the skin. They can be quite painful. Some may mistake plantar warts for calluses. The main difference in appearance is that plantar warts have small black dots, which are capillaries. Plantar warts can be contracted by walking on dirty surfaces where the virus is present. Make sure to wear flip-flops at the gym or outside, and socks while walking around the house.</p>
    <p>Genital warts are the most commonly transmitted STI by a virus and have the potential to cause cervical cancer in women. They are easily transmitted, and can be contracted after just one sexual encounter with someone who is infected. HPV 6 and 11 cause 90% of genital warts, but have the least like cancer causing potential. HPV 16 is known to cause 50% of cervical cancer. Two thirds of those who contract genital warts show symptoms within three months. Symptoms of genital warts include bumps, itching and discharge. There are 5.5 million new cases in the US every year, with 20 million people already thought to be infected.</p>
    <p><strong>Tips for prevention</strong> </p>
    <li>Avoid walking anywhere barefoot, except for sandy beaches. This is especially important in locker rooms. The virus thrives in moist, warm environments. </li>
    <li>Change socks and shoes daily </li>
    <li>Avoid direct contact with those who have warts </li>
    <li>Keep feet clean and dry </li>
    <li>Go to a dermatologist if you experience growths or changes in your skin

  ingredients: |-
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Desiccated Liver:</strong> The ultimate in palatability. This fresh, natural  flavor of real liver is wonderful for the finicky eater because when  mixed with water, makes a great gravy that dogs crave. Supplies iron  and B vitamins</li>
        <li><strong>Norwegian Kelp:</strong> A natural seaweed that is a rich source of trace  minerals including iodine, which is used for proper glandular function  and metabolism. An excellent source of vitamins A, B1, B2, C, and E.  These vitamins are beneficial for maintaining proper health and are  responsible for the growth of bones, a healthy heart rate, a sound  central nervous system, and helping muscles stay firm and strong. Aside  from nourishing the glands, it is beneficial for overall good health.  Supports healthy pigmentation and coat highlights. </li>
        <li><strong>Micropulverized Bee Pollen:</strong> One of nature&rsquo;s healthiest and most  powerful &lsquo;superfoods.&rsquo; Bee pollen contains an incredible array of  vitamins, minerals, amino acids and enzymes. It&rsquo;s one of the most  nutritionally complete natural substances found on earth. Supports a  healthy immune system. Keeps healthy hormones in balance. Supports  allergy protection. </li>
        <li><strong>Imported Yeast Culture:</strong> Helps maintain a full and healthy coat  which may minimize the occurrence of excessive shedding, hot spots and  itchy, dry fur. Provides proteins, zinc and biotin. Best source of B  vitamins. Most companies use cheaper brewers yeast which can be a  combination of hops, corn, grains, wheat, etc., whatever comes from the  brewery. Many animals have grain allergies, and this ingredient may  further aggravate an allergy condition. With nutritional yeast culture,  it is grown on sugar beets, a veggie source, so NO grains are present  at all. </li>
        <li><strong>Flaxseed and Ground Borage Seed:</strong> Provides essential fatty acids.  Most absorbable vegetable fatty acid for the canine. Rich in omega 3  fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid, fiber and lignans.<br />   Lecithin: A  rich source of choline, which the body requires to make acetylcholine,  a neurotransmitter which is essential for normal, healthy nerve and  brain function. Supports healthy liver function, too.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic Concentrate</strong>: Garlic contains allicin, a broad-spectrum  antimicrobial capable of warding off different types of infection.  Supports a healthy immune system. <br />     Lactobacillus Acidophilus:  Promotes healthy digestion which may reduce the occurrence of  flatulence. Also promotes friendly bacteria in intestinal tract. </li>
        <li><strong>Calcium Citrate:</strong> Calcium is best absorbed in an acidic  environment, hence calcium citrate is the best absorbed supplemental  form of calcium---it does not require extra stomach acid for  absorption. Intended to provide nutritive support for healthy bones,  teeth and nerve function.</li>

    <p><strong>Why does your dog need a dietary supplement? </strong><br />The processing practice of most of the commercial pet foods involve high heats, cooking, rendering, freezing, dehydrating, canning, extruding, pelleting, and so forth. Processing meat and by-products used in pet food can greatly diminish or even destroy their nutritional value. </p>
    <p>Many of the commercial brands of dog food are not well-balanced and do not provide all the nutrients for a healthy system and body. A lifetime spent on these foods can be starving your dog of vital nutrients. Both healthy and ailing dogs can benefit from the addition of nutritional supplements. </p>
    <p>NUPRO is made with fresh quality health food ingredients that are human-grade, not animal-grade. Contains a full range of vitamins, minerals, enzymes, amino acids, and essential fatty acids in their natural raw forms. Whether you use commercial diets, or cook for your animals, a supplement is an essential part of your daily nutritional program.</p>

    <p>Hi, my name is Randy from East Point, GA. This morning while getting ready for work, my Corgi &quot;Marty&quot; got a hold of my empty jar of Nupro, and proceeded to get his head stuck in the jar! I couldn't get it off, so I went to the garage and got some wire cutters and cut through the plastic. Attached is a picture of him I quickly took with my digital camera. I couldn't help but laugh, he looked so pitiful with that jar on his head! I thought you might find this funny...I guess it's quite a testimony to your product! ;)<br />Sincerely, Randy</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#800000">Customer Testimonial<br /></font></strong>Hello,<br />This is one of the rare times I&rsquo;ve sat down to write a letter of appreciation for a product. I&rsquo;ve been doing rescue work with animals for almost fifteen years, and over the course of time I&rsquo;ve learned how imperative good nutrition is to an animal&rsquo;s health (especially to the abused and neglected pets who have come my way). I try to use only natural, holistic care for the animals, and one product that&rsquo;s a basic part of the program is Nupro. This is such a high quality, well balanced supplement, incorporating exactly the right mixture of nutrients. I used to buy many of the same supplements individually at a much higher over-all price! And the results are apparent in just a matter of weeks, even in animals with long term skin and health problems.<br />A perfect example is Zoe, a dog that was just recently turned in because her owner was tired of dealing with her skin condition. She was suffering from terrible allergies, was almost bald, covered in sores and hot spots, itched constantly, and had a severe ear infection. Her owner had been treating her for almost a year with antibiotics, steroids, and chemicals dips and baths. I immediately took her off those treatments, put her on a natural (no by-products, no preserves) dog food, and added Nupro (plus some herbs to boost her immune system). It&rsquo;s now been just over one month, and not only has her skin cleared up completely, but her fur is starting to come in silky soft and her ears have healed! She&rsquo;s bright eyed, full of energy, and will soon be ready for adoption!<br />I&rsquo;ve been giving out samples of Nupro with each adoption and will continue to encourage everyone to try this supplement for their pets. Thank you for such a quality product!</p>
    <p>Sincerely, Lori</p>
    <p><strong><font color="#800000">Customer Testimonial<br /></font></strong>I would like to relate a bit of my experience with Nupro. I have two Rottweilers, both rescues, who have been on Nupro since January of this year. Maia (approximately 1 year old female) was VERY underweight and had been through some physical abuse. Bear (4 year old male) had been starved and severely abused. I immediately put them on the Nupro mixed with water in their kibble, when they came home with me. The difference in them not only physically, but temperamentally has been nothing short of wonderful. When I say temperament, I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that they were vicious, in fact quite the opposite, they were both very nervous and frankly scared. But lots of love, patience, consistency, and an excellent diet (which includes Nupro at every meal) has them in wonderful condition. </p>
    <p>Maia was a very slim 50.5 lbs when she came to me. She&rsquo;s now a very healthy 65 lbs (and gaining), beautiful muscle-tone, and a personality that just lights up a room! Bear&rsquo;s weight was pretty good when he came to me, but his coat was a MESS! Now his coat is beautiful. He plays like a puppy, and he&rsquo;s steady as a rock. He&rsquo;s also about 110 lbs these days!</p>
    <p>I can say that I will not be without Nupro for my &quot;babies&quot;, and recommend it enthusiastically. Bear and Maia would too, since they wolf it down! Many thanks, and I look forward to speaking with you again.<br /><br />Regards, Lois</p>

    <p><strong>About respiratory problems in cats</strong></p>
    <p>Many cats &ndash; especially very young and older cats &ndash; are prone to catching upper respiratory infections, similar to colds in humans. These tend to be highly contagious, so it&rsquo;s best to keep an infected cat away from others (if possible).</p>
    <p>Respiratory infections can be hard on kittens and elderly cats, occasionally resulting in death. And even for otherwise healthy and strong cats, respiratory infections are very unpleasant &ndash; just as a cold or flu is unpleasant to you. So it&rsquo;s a good idea to get treatment, if only to ease your cat&rsquo;s symptoms.</p>
    <p><strong>Common symptoms cat respiratory infections</strong></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s quite easy to tell when your cat is suffering from an upper-respiratory infection. Look for these symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sneezing </li>
        <li>Runny nose </li>
        <li>Watery eyes </li>
        <li>&quot;Rattling&quot; breath, husky purring </li>
        <li>Snoring </li>
        <li>Reduced energy levels </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Can Respiratory Aid help?</strong></p>
    <p>The herbal extracts in Respiratory Aid have been carefully combined to provide the ultimate in relief to your cat&rsquo;s breathing problems and other symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fights infections </li>
        <li>Builds your cat&rsquo;s natural defenses </li>
        <li>Opens cat&rsquo;s airways, allows easier breathing </li>
        <li>Fights all symptoms of upper-respiratory infection </li>
        <li>Helps prevent spread of infection to other cats </li>
        <li>Helps prevent reoccurrence of infection </li>
        <li>Improves cat&rsquo;s comfort and disposition </li>
        <li>Doctor-formulated, vet-approved </li>
        <li>Safe and natural </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We believe &ndash; and our customers agree &ndash; that Respiratory Aid is the best formula available for treating upper respiratory infections in cats. If your cat is prone to such infections, give it a try. Your cat will thank you! </p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word&hellip;</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;I used Respiratory Aid on my cat Trig, the sweetest cat ever. She seemed to be bouncing from one cold to another. Respiratory Aid has really helped her. She rarely gets colds any more, and when she does, she&rsquo;s not as troubled by them. Please feel free to use this email as a testimonial.&quot; Ashley, Cleveland OH</p>

    <p>After using your regular method of hair removal, apply either the lotion or spray to the desired area. Make sure your skin is clean before doing this. If you are applying the lotion, massage it into the skin until it is fully absorbed.</p>
    <p>If you are using the spray, apply to desired area and leave until dry. After waiting approximately 15 minutes, apply either the lotion or spray again. Do this once more after another 15 minute interval so that the Kalo product has been applied 3 times after hair removal.</p>
    <p>It is important to apply the Kalo products soon after hair removal for maximum effectiveness. The day after hair removal, apply Kalo three times in the same fashion as stated above. After the second day, wait until your next hair removal session before applying Kalo inhibitors again.</p>
    <p>For maximum results, apply the spray three times, and apply the lotion once the day of hair removal.</p>

Out ward \r\n        signs are not always apparent, so it is important to have your vet check \r\n        your dog\xE2\x80\x99s ears at each regular check up. If left unattended, infection \r\n        may ensue. Bacteria will have access to tissue through holes made by mites. \r\n        This infection has the ability to spread to the brain, possibly causing \r\n        convulsions and even death. <br>\r\n        <br>\r\n        Many dogs will scratch which can cause reinfestation through the paws \r\n        or tail. Persistent scratching can lead to bald patches due to the hair \r\n        being torn out, and eventual bleeding \r\n      <p><strong><font color=\"006666\">Ingredients</font></strong><br>\r\n        Verbascum thapsus: Expectorant, demulcent, vulnerary, mild sedative, antiviral \r\n        activity against HSV 1 and influenza.</p>\r\n      <p>Hypericum perforatum: Best known for its action as an antidepressant. \r\n        Also used to treat anxiety, nervous unrest and pain associated with neuralgia. \r\n        The oil formed is applied topically to areas of neuralgia, myalgia, contusions, \r\n        and rheumatism.</p>\r\n      <p>Azadirachta: As a medicated oil, it is one of the best healing and disinfectant \r\n        agents for skin diseases.</p>\r\n      <p>Calendula officinalis: Internal and topical use of calendula flowers \r\n        for inflammation of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa.

Eardrops are more effective if slightly \r\n        warm to the touch. Insert the sealed tincture bottle in warm water for \r\n        five minutes, then test a drop on the back of your hand.

            </strong></font>Mineral deposits and stone formation (urinary calculi) 
            in the urinary tract are a common cat problem indicating feline kidney 
            failure. Stones cause bladder-lining irritation; if their diameter is 
            big enough, they can cause partial or complete urinary obstruction. Poor 
            diet, including high sodium intake, can lead to high blood pressure. This 
            particular symptom is a precursor to kidney disease. Increasing fluid 
            intake can help dilute the sodium content found in the diet. The use of 
            herbs is recommended to ease the symptoms of kidney disease in cats, relieving 
            pain and avoiding infections.

    <p><strong>Why use a multi vitamin for your dog?</strong></p>
    <p>Just like humans, dogs require certain vitamins to maintain proper metabolism and fight off disease. Vitamins and nutrients may be obtained through food, directly or indirectly. But sometimes the forms of vitamins found in food are not easily absorbed. For this reason, the nutritional contents listed on dog food packaging can sometimes be misleading.</p>
    <p>Canine Multi Essential vitamins will help give your dog the vitamins and nutrients he may not be getting from his food. These carefully chosen herbal extracts provide a superlative source of easily-digested vitamins and minerals. They&rsquo;ll help your dog stay healthy and active, and help him resist disease.</p>
    <p><strong>Common Symptoms of Vitamin Deficiency</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Skin problems </li>
        <li>Poor coat quality or loss of fur </li>
        <li>Poor reproductive performance </li>
        <li>Lack of energy and enthusiasm </li>
    </ul>

When your dog has an ear infection they will often show \r\n        discomfort by scratching at their ear, or by continually shaking their \r\n        head. The ear then becomes inflame, and with discharge black or yellowish \r\n        fluid accompanied by an offensive odor.

Less commonly, problems involve the middle ear (otitis \r\n        media) or the inner ear (otitis interna). Ailments can be caused by water, \r\n        foreign bodies (insects, seeds, parasites), excessive cerumen (earwax) \r\n        or allergies. Ear mites are common parasites in pet's ears that can cause \r\n        huge inflammation.Otitis external is easier to treat than the other types. \r\n        Keeping the ear canal clean, free of debris and secretions, helps to reduce \r\n        irritation and calm the problem. Water inside the ear canal will increase \r\n        the problem and should be avoided. Otitis usually is very painful; analgesics \r\n        relieve pain and calm the animal. Dry warm compresses can also act as \r\n        pain reliever.

If you are not sure if your pet has cancer, here are \r\n        some common symptoms:\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li> Weight loss or loss of appetite\r\n\
    \t\t<li> Stiffness, loss of stamina, difficulty breathing\r\n\
    \t\t<li> Bleeding or discharge from any body opening or sores that do \r\n        not heal\r\n\
    \t\t<li> Foul odor\r\n\
    \t\t<li> Abnormal swelling that increases in size and does not go away\r\n\
    \t\t<li> Difficulty urinating or defecating</ul>\r\n      <P>Skin cancer is not too common in cats, but most skin tumors are malignant. \r\n        Make sure to get anything suspicious checked out by your vet. Breast tumors \r\n        are also common in cats, and up to 85% are malignant. Spaying your pet \r\n        between 6 and 12 months of age will help reduce the risk of breast cancer. \r\n        Cancer of the mouth is not in common in cats as it is in dogs. Some symptoms \r\n        to watch out for are a mass on the gums, bleeding, difficulty breathing \r\n        or swelling around the facial area. Other cancers to be aware of are lymphoma, \r\n        feline leukemia and abdominal tumors. \r\n      <p><strong><font color=\"006666\">Ingredients</font></strong><br>\r\n        Burdock: Considered one of the best herbs to use as a nutritive liver \r\n        tonic, that helps clean the blood.

    <p><strong><span>Why use a multi vitamin for your cat?</span></strong></p>
    <p><span>Vitamins and minerals are necessary to ensure all the body's functions are working properly. They also help animals in the prevention and treatment of many illnesses. The levels of vitamins and minerals needed in the body can vary according to factors like age and lifestyle. These nutrients are obtained by pets through food (e.g. cats can make their own vitamin A from carotenes found in vegetables), but sometimes they are not in the easiest form for the animal to absorb. Feline Multi Essential vitamins can help give your pet the proper nutrients he may not be obtaining from his current diet. Including pet vitamins in the form of herbal extracts can provide an excellent source of energy; vitamins and minerals found in plants are readily and efficiently absorbed into your pet's body. These can help avoid anemia, malnutrition and digestive problems.</span><strong></strong></p>

  name: Prowl Cat Food
  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:27
  dosage: |-
    <p>  Designed to not only taste good, but to be easy on the human family as well, Prowl mixes easily and only requires warm water to hydrate the food.  This form of dehydration followed by hydration is good for cats as they can use the extra moisture to keep their fine-tuned digestive systems healthy.</p>
    <p><strong>Portion Guidelines</strong><br /> Serve the proper measure of dry Prowl, as per the cat's weight, in a bowl with a little warm water.  If the cat weighs -</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1-6 lbs, serve 1-6 tablespoons per day</li>
        <li>6-10 lbs, serve 6-10 tablespoons per day</li>
        <li>10-16 lbs, serve 8-14 tablespoons per day</li>
        <li>16-20 lbs, serve 14-16 tablespoons per day</li>
    </ul>
    <p> One tablespoon of Prowl will make about 1/2 oz of fresh food when hydrated </p>
    <p><strong> Yield Guidelines</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> One tablespoon of Prowl added to water - makes approximately &frac12; ounce of fresh food</li>
        <li>A four pound box when hydrated - makes approximately 10 pounds of fresh food</li>
    </ul>
    <p>  This becomes an economical way to serve nutritious goodness to those we love.</p>

    <p>Prowl can be fed as a stand alone diet, or as a nutritionally balanced base for home made raw or cooked meals. Keep in mind, cats really enjoy    a varied diet and it may be wise to rotate between several different meats as a tasty  addition to Prowl. </p>
    <p>Created from top ingredients of only the finest quality, this cat food is trend setting for felines. One of the joys of feeding Prowl dehydrated raw food to your cats is how easy the dry food rehydrates.  You just mix a little warm water to the dry measure and stir.</p>
    <p><strong>  You and your cats will adore this food.  Why?  </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is all natural
        <ul>
            <li>Uses meat from hormone and antibiotic free animals</li>
            <li>Uses fruits and vegetables that are NOT genetically modified</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li> It is full of vitamins and minerals to ensure your cat's nutritional needs are met</li>
        <li>It is free of fillers - as it's made entirely of good healthy meat, vegetables, fruits and vitamin/mineral supplements</li>
        <li>It is grain free -  cats are essentially carnivores with a limited ability to digest grains</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dry kibble-style cat food is not a good choice for most cats. Grains are a very poor choice for felines who are obligate carnivores and can digest only a very small amount of vegetable ingredients in their diet.</p>
    <p><strong>Prowl is equal in quality to any fresh food diet </strong></p>
    <p>Prowl contains absolutely no by-products, added salt or sugar, chemical preservatives,  artificial colors or flavors and NO beet pulp, rice, wheat, corn, or soy.</p>

    <p> It's easy to store, simple to hydrate, and as a dry food, it's great for traveling.  Best of all - Prowl dehydrated raw food tastes great too!  Even the most discerning of cats will enjoy this fancy feline feast.</p>
    <p><strong>Why cats will enjoy and should eat this food</strong></p>
    <p>  Prowl, is high in protein content at almost 33% straight out of the box, it is a perfect whole meal for adult cats.  However, if you are already making homemade cat food and would like to keep doing that, then Prowl makes an excellent supplement to ensure that your pet receives all the necessary nutrients for a long and healthy life. </p>
    <p> If you have kittens, Prowl can be served along with additional protein to make a complete meal for these young and active pets. </p>

Even if the injury or irritation \r\n        is small and superficial in the beginning and consequently not often seen, \r\n        as pets start scratching their eyes, they can damage the cornea. Conjunctivitis \r\n        in dogs can cause chronic irritation, which will lead to ulcer formation. \r\n        Once this process is initiated, the ulcer can become deeper; leading to \r\n        corneal perforation and consequent vision impairment. The body repairs \r\n        the ulcer with fibrous tissue replacement, causing corneal opaque spots \r\n        and permanent scarring in the visual field. Deep corneal ulcers can be \r\n        a serious problem. Owners must pay careful attention when pets start showing \r\n        signs of eye irritation.

            oozes from the eye, and the surrounding mucous becomes inflamed, giving 
            it a red tinge, hence, pink eye. Pink eye can be caused by allergies, 
            trauma (cat fights), foreign bodies, mechanical and chemical irritants, 
            bacteria, viruses and mycoplasmas. In worst-case scenarios, pink eye can 
            cause blindness, but only if left untreated. Conjunctivitis can be contagious 
            among cats, so make sure to keep your cat away from other cats that are 
            infected, or vice versa.

    <p><strong>About washing your cat</strong></p>
    <p>Your cat's coat is exposed to the elements every day; healthy fur means a healthy cat. Increase the health of your cat's coat by bathing him once a month with this anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, insect repellant soap. More frequent washing is not recommended as this can cause loss of natural skin oils and lead to dry, irritated skin.</p>

  dosage: |-
    <p>If your pet is already on a raw food diet, then it works well to rehydrate Force and mix with the normal diet right away.  For other pets that are new to this type of food and have been eating dry kibbles or canned dog food, then introduce Force gradually over several days to a week.  Follow the guidelines on the package and mix a little of the rehydrated Force to the regular dry or canned for at the beginning.  Over the course of the next few days, slowly reduce the amount of dry or canned food and increase the amount of Force so the ratio if 1:1.  Then reduce the amount of dry or canned food until you are feeding Force only.  By changing your pets diet over slowly to the new food, their intestinal tract has time to adjust and will become more efficient at digesting the new food.</p>
    <p><strong>Mixing Instructions</strong><br /> Each dry measured cup of Force should be mixed with 1 to 1 &frac12; cups of warm water.  After stirring, let sit for 5-10 minutes for the mixture to hydrate. It will resemble oatmeal or a stew when ready to serve. At this point, you can mix in your pet&rsquo;s choice of vegetables, fruit raw or cooked meats or bones.  Serve right away.  If the dog doesn't finish the serving, be sure to pick up the remainder and refrigerate until the next meal.  If there is any food remaining after 48 hours, discard.</p>
    <p> <strong>Yield Guidelines</strong><br /> When mixing by the guidelines the hydrated mix will yield the following:</p>
    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>4 oz. 		or 	 	1 cup</td>
                <td>makes about 1 lb of fresh food</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4 lbs 		or		16 to 17 cups</td>
                <td>makes about 16 to 17 lbs of fresh food</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>10 lbs 		or		40 to 43 cups</td>
                <td> makes about 40 to 43 lbs of fresh food</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Feeding Guidelines</strong><br />   Serve the proper measure of dry Force, as per the dog&rsquo;s weight, in a bowl with warm water as per the mixing instructions above.  The following daily amounts can be adjusted to suit the variations of breed, age and level of activity as required for each dog. </p>
    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Dog's Weight</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Less Active Dogs</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Very Active Dogs</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 10 lbs</td>
                <td>1/2 Cup</td>
                <td>1 Cup </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 30 lbs </td>
                <td>1 Cup </td>
                <td>2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 50 lbs</td>
                <td>2 Cups </td>
                <td>2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 70 lbs </td>
                <td>2 1/4 Cups </td>
                <td>4 1/2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 90 lbs </td>
                <td>2 3/4 Cups </td>
                <td>5 1/2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Although a &frac12; or 1 cup may not seem like a lot for one serving, remember that one cup ends up equal to one pound of fresh.  Then if you add in extras for the dog, this becomes an even bigger serving.  Therefore serve on the lighter side to begin with and increase only if more is necessary.</p>

    <p><strong>Raw food is what nature intended for dogs.</strong>  Raw food is more nutritious - in fact, it's bursting with vitamins and vital antioxidants. And then we gently dehydrate, because dehydration is gentler than cooking and simply removes the moisture; almost all nutrients,  enzymes and other valuable compounds remain in tact.</p>
    <p>Force can be fed alone or as a supplement to any homemade food diet that your pet currently enjoys. Raw dehydrated food is different from the more conventional kibble or even cooked and processed foods, it is important to allow enough time for your pet to adjust to the change in diet. </p>
    <p>Force, was designed to be as good as raw homemade dog food and much better than the dry dog kibble or canned food that is so often fed to our pets.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Force contains no by-products, extra salts or sugars, artificial colors or flavors, and no chemical preservatives</strong>.  Other common ingredients in commercial kibble dog food that are NOT in Force include beet pulp, rice, wheat, corn or soy.  The reason for not including these ingredients is that they are considered to be common allergens for dogs.  They can cause problems like dry or itchy skin, lack of energy, ear problems and even hair loss. </p>
    <p>  In fact, Force was originally designed  for dogs that have sensitive stomachs or other chronic ailments that could have come from eating grains and gluten.  By removing these ingredients from the diet, many animals find relief and return to vibrant health.  </p>
    <p>  Just because the product is healthy and nutritious, does not mean that it has be tasteless or even worse &ndash; awful tasting.  That's simply not true.  Force is delicious and dogs love it.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Force contains only the freshest top quality ingredients, </strong>which are then gently dehydrated in such a way as to preserve the high vitamin, mineral and enzyme levels in the food. This process is perfectly safe and very healthy.  Meats and eggs are dehydrated slightly differently.  They are dehydrated at high temperatures to kill any bacterial and could be considered 'cooked' by the process.   The finished dried food is healthy, nutritious, and safe for puppies and older animals.</p>
    <p>  Force is made in a FDA inspected production facility in California, where human foods like breakfast cereals and drink mixes are also made.  As a food production facility, it undergoes regular FDA inspections.</p>
    <p>Force can be fed as a standalone diet.  Or if your dog desires, other foods can be added to the regular serving size .  </p>
    <p><strong>You and your dogs will adore this food.  Why? </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li> Convenience</li>
        <li>Nutritional balance</li>
        <li>Grain and filler free</li>
        <li>All natural wholesome ingredients</li>
        <li>Food safety over raw or frozen diets</li>
        <li>Time savings in food preparation over homemade diets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Force dog food is a  delicious product that is simple to store, easy to hydrate and great to take along on your travels.  As you appreciate the peace of mind of buying the best for your pet, your dog will appreciate the taste and good health.</p>

The affected limb must be examined to \r\n        find the source of the problem and the injured area treated. Be sure to \r\n        encourage rest for the cat to speed the healing process.

    <p><strong><br />   About washing your dog </strong><br /> Your dog&rsquo;s coat is constantly exposed to the elements and can pick up all kinds of dirty, smelly matter. Keeping your dog&rsquo;s fur clean and healthy is important not only for you (so you don&rsquo;t have to endure the bad smell) but also for your dog. A clean coat is a healthy coat.</p>
    <p> About once a month, give your dog a healthy bath. It&rsquo;ll keep his coat clean and healthy. </p>
    <p>Neem Soap for Dogs</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Repels insects which can cause allergies</li>
        <li>Anti-bacterial, Anti-fungal</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Bathing your dog more than once a month is not recommended (except in emergencies like skunk spray or other extremely dirty/smelly messes). Excessive bathing with even the best dog soap can lead to the loss of your dog&rsquo;s natural skin oils and make his skin dry and irritated. </p>

  name: Verve Dog Food
  available_on: 2009-11-25 12:05:27
  dosage: |-
    <p>Verve raw dehydrated dog food acts as standalone meals.  These meals are nutritionally complete to keep your dog happy and healthy.  However, many people like to use Verve, as a supplement to an already raw or homemade dog food diet.</p>
    <p> Keep in mind that making the switch to a raw dehydrated food from commercial kibble or canned food is easier for your pet if you transit them to the new food slowly.  By switching the food in this way, the dog&rsquo;s intestinal flora has time to adapt and will become more efficient at digesting the new food.</p>
    <p>If your pet is already on a raw food diet, then you can mix hydrated Verve into the dog&rsquo;s normal diet right away.  If this is a new kind of food for your dog, then introduce Verve gradually over several days to a week.  Mix a little Verve, according to the instructions, and stir into your dogs&rsquo; normal kibble or canned food.  Over the next couple of days, slowly reduce the amount of dry or canned food served and increase the amount of Verve until the mixture is one to one.  Then carry on in the same way so that the old dog food is slowly reduced until you are feeding only Verve.</p>
    <p><strong>Mixing Instructions</strong><br /> Verve raw dehydrated foods, should be mixed with 1 to 1 &frac12; cups of warm water.  Stir well, then let sit for a good 5 &ndash; 10 minutes for the mixture to hydrate properly.  When it is ready, it will resemble oatmeal or a stew.  The way in which the food is dehydrated, maintains the bright color of the ingredients.  Once the mixture is ready, you can add in up to &frac12; cup of your pet&rsquo;s favorite extras like meat, vegetables, fruit, or even bones.  At this point, serve the meal right away instead of waiting.  If the food is not totally consumed at one time, refrigerate the leftovers.  If there is still some of this same food left after 48 hours, it&rsquo;s time to throw it out and start fresh.</p>
    <p><strong>Yield Guidelines</strong><br /> By following the guidelines, this hydrated raw dog food produces the following yields:</p>

    <p><br />   <strong>Feeding Guidelines</strong><br /> Honest Kitchen Verve should be measured and served based on the dog&rsquo;s weight and type of lifestyle.

    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0">

                <td>1 Cup</td>
                <td>2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 50 lbs</td>
                <td>2 Cups</td>
                <td>4 Cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 70 lbs</td>
                <td>2 1/4 Cups</td>
                <td>4 1/2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Up to 90 lbs</td>
                <td>2 3/4 Cups</td>
                <td>5 1/2 Cups</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Some dogs will require more and some less.  Start with the proper measurement, and consider that although it may not appear to be enough for some dogs, you can add in from &frac12; to 1 cup of additional fresh food to each serving.  For best results, wait until Verve is well hydrated before adding in fresh food.</p>

    <p><strong>The Best of Both Worlds &ndash; For Powerful Hair Re-Growth</strong></p>
    <p>Hair loss can be caused by genetics, hormones or the environment. The main culprit is usually a hormonal byproduct called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It gradually shrinks hair follicles until they become dormant or die.</p>
    <p>Products that reduce the effects of DHT can stop hair loss. And with proper nourishment, damaged and dormant hair follicles can be repaired and reactivated, resulting in new hair growth. </p>
    <p>This intensive 3-month program combines the two leading anti-DHT products: Hair Essentials and Revivogen. Here&rsquo;s how they work:</p>
    <p><strong>ORAL TREATMENT: HAIR ESSENTIALS</strong></p>
    <p><strong>How does Hair Essentials promote new hair growth?</strong></p>
    <p>First, it fights DHT to prevent further hair loss. It does this with a powerful combinations of herbs, clinically proven to decrease DHT levels in the bloodstream more effectively than chemical treatments.</p>
    <p>Next, Hair Essentials seeds your follicles with everything they need for new hair growth. Taken orally, Hair Essentials&rsquo; powerful nutrients are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and go straight to your scalp. There, they repair damaged hair follicles and kick-start inactive ones. The result? Healthy new hair growth!</p>
    <p><strong>Other hair growth products appear to be similar. How is Hair Essentials different?</strong></p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s a classic example of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts: what really makes Hair Essentials work is its unique, synergistic combination of ingredients. Some combat DHT, stopping further hair loss. The other ingredients repair your follicles and aggressively seed them with all the nutrients they need to grow healthy new hair.</p>
    <p>ONLY Hair Essentials contains our painstakingly researched, Doctor-formulated combination of powerful herbs, each reinforcing the effects of the others. Quite simply, there&rsquo;s no other oral hair growth product that comes close to Hair Essentials.</p>
    <p><strong>TOPICAL TREATMENT: REVIVOGEN</strong></p>
    <p>Revivogen is a natural topical formula, which works through the same mechanism as Propecia&reg;. Revivogen is made with natural ingredients that have been scientifically proven to reduce DHT production. In fact, the active ingredients in Revivogen reduce DHT even more effectively than Propecia&reg;. What&rsquo;s more, these ingredients prevent DHT's attachment to the hair follicle, which is not done by Propecia&reg;.</p>
    <p>By reducing DHT's production and its destructive effects on the hair follicle, the weakened and miniaturized hairs become thicker and stronger again, leading to a fuller and healthier head of hair. By targeting the cause of hair loss at the molecular level, Revivogen's powerful natural ingredients revitalize and protect the hair, blocking the androgen receptor and stimulating hair growth.</p>
    <p>Within six to eight weeks of using Revivogen you can expect a significant decrease in hair loss and appreciate a difference in how your hair looks and feels. With continued use, the hair quality will continue to improve and stay healthy with best results occurring after twelve to eighteen months. Once the desired results are achieved, continued use of Revivogen is needed to maintain the revitalized hair.</p>

    <p><strong>Clinical Trial</strong></p>
    <p>One-hundred and forty-eight participants with varying degrees of male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) participated in an open-ended study using an all natural compound solution to determine the effects of hair re-growth. The participants were photographed and initial hair counts were done in a 2.5 cm diameter area of their balding scalp. After five months of treatment, the participants were re-photographed and hair counts were done on the same 2.5 cm diameter area of the scalp. The results indicate that 85.7% of the men in the study had an increase in their terminal hairs of 30% or greater. When evaluating the percent increase more closely, we find that we can break the data down into three separate groups.</p>
    <p>Showing significant re-growth was 40.8% of the study group who had an increase of 100% or greater (doubling, tripling, or more) of terminal hairs counted on their five month post-treatment photo as compared to their initial pre-treatment photo. Of this group, the highest increase of hairs was 472%, and the lowest increase was 102% with the mean at 193.7% increase of hairs.</p>
    <p>The group of men showing moderate re-growth, which we classed as 30%-100% increase in terminal hair re-growth, was 44.9% of the study group. The mean increase of that group was a 61.5% increase of hair re-growth.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the group, classed as no change, was 14.3% of the study group, with an average of 6.7% increase in re-growth</p>
    <p>Participants were told to use at least one bottle per month (five bottles in five months) but were allowed to use more if desired. We did not see any significant advantage to using more than one bottle per month. Our conclusion is that the stimulatory effect of the compound is achieved at the use rate of one bottle per month.</p>
    <p>The age range of the participants in their ability to restore hair growth was not a factor. The range of the participants in this study was 24-68 years old, with the average age being 38.7 years.</p>
    <p>In summary, this study concludes that the natural herbal extract solution has a stimulatory effect on restoring hair growth for at least 8 out of 10 men with androgenic alopecia (balding). The earlier stages of balding appear to respond to a higher degree, but significant improvement was seen in participants at all stages of baldness. There appears to be an optimum rate of use of the product, and age does not seem to be a factor in response.</p>
    <p>Although the qualitative and quantitative assessments were done independently, there was a strong correlation between the two groups. Overall, 88% of the qualitative group showed some degree of improvement. Of the group studied quantitatively, 85.7% showed a degree of re-growth (within 95% confidence limits). With the qualitative group, 6 of 50 men were categorized as having no change (category 0), representing 12% of the total. In the quantitative group (98 participants), 14 men, or 14.3% did not show any increase in hair counts. The average hair count increase for this group was 6.7%. So most subjects in this group did regrow some hair, but not a noticeable amount.</p>
    <p>The moderately improved qualitative group (category 1) consisted of 16 participants, or 32%. In the quantitatively studied group, 44 of 98 men fell into the range of +30% to +100%. This represents 44.9% of the men. The range of increase was 32% to 98%, with the mean at 61.5% The participants showing significant re-growth in the qualitative group (category 2) were 28 of 50, or 56%. In the quantitatively studied group, the number of men with significant re-growth (greater than 100%) was 40 of 98, or 40.8%. These men had hair count increases of 100% or more. The range of hair count increases was 102% to 472%, with a mean increase of 194%. The photograph of these men and women showed significant cosmetic changes which correlates very well with our quantitative findings.</p>
    <p>From the photos taken monthly during the course of the study, a pattern of re-growth was observed in those participants who demonstrated a significant increase in hair counts over the five months. The first countable hairs were seen after 10-12 weeks of treatment and were first detected on the crown or vertex of the head. Following further treatment, hair was then observed re-growing in the thinning or balding areas of the scalp. Hair re-growth in the fronto-temporal region of the scalp was noted after 16-20 weeks of treatment, and this region appeared to be the most resistant to re-growth to date.</p>
    <p>This open-ended study has demonstrated the hair re-growth response of 148 men who have been treated with an all natural compound solution applied topically to balding or thinning regions of the scalp. The treatment program included regular scalp cleansing with a natural extract scalp cleanser and application of at least 5-10 ml of the all natural compound solution at least twice daily. The data showed that hair counts increased significantly for approximately 85% of the participants in the five month period.</p>
    <p>The study methodology implies that the results obtained relate not only to the all natural compound solution used in the treatment, but also the overall treatment regimen. From previous minoxidil (Rogaine) papers, it was determined by them that a reasonable expectation for a &quot;placebo-type&quot; effect was a 10-15% increase in hair counts. Thus, by setting the cut-off in this study for moderate re-growth at a 30% increase, any increase due to a &quot;placebo-type&quot; effect is discounted.</p>
    <p>An attempt was made to correlate the response (either no change, moderate change, or significant change) with a number of factors. None of the factors studied gave a strong correlation, although there were some trends noted. The number of years of balding or thinning hair did not appear to have any correlation with the final results. However, it should be noted that the number of years thinning was a number given by the participants, and could not be verified accurately. Thus it is a subject of assessment and may not be very reliable. To help balance this uncertainty, the results were grouped. Regardless of the groupings used, there was no grouping which demonstrated a significant correlation with results.</p>
    <p>In terms of hair re-growth, this all natural compound solution appears to be more effective than minoxidil (Rogaine) and has no known side effects. A study by Alanis showed that a 2% minoxidil preparation applied topically increased hair counts by about 24% after 20 weeks. This study showed an increase of 89% in the same time period. Because of the differences in locating the measured regions of the scalp, these results are not directly comparable, but in a population study, Alanis's results showed that 34-46 out of 83 participants (48%) had no growth after 24 weeks, whereas our results show only 14 out of 98 (14%) had no growth after 20 weeks. </p>
    <p>Thus, our conclusion is that this product does stimulate re-growth of hair in cases of androgenic alopecia (balding), and that over 85% of men will respond favorably to the treatment. </p>

Arthritis is a breakdown in the cartilage cushioning the joints. \r\n        Pets may become more sensitive to exercise, walking up and down stairs \r\n        and being touched. Telltale signs include:<ul>\r\n        <li> Favouring on side of the body\r\n        <li>  Avoidance of motion (walking, exercising, etc)\r\n        <li>  Limping\r\n       <li>  Slowness to get up\r\n       <li> Fever\r\n        <li>  Lack of appetite\r\n        <li>  Reluctance to be touched\r\n       <li>  Stiffness</ul>\r\n      <p>Cats can be affected by either of the two type of arthritis. The first \r\n        is Osteoarthritis, which tends to happen with age, although can affect \r\n        younger cats that have sustained trauma to the cartilage. The cartilage \r\n        will decrease with age, until the joints are rubbing against each other, \r\n        causing pain and discomfort. The second type of arthritis is Rheumatoid \r\n        arthritis, which is the case when the body\xE2\x80\x99s own immune system will \r\n        attack the cartilage as if it were a foreign agent. To try and prevent \r\n        arthritis, keep your cat at a healthy weight, and keep them active (but \r\n        don\xE2\x80\x99t over exercise them). This will keep the joints well lubricated, \r\n        and reduce any strain from extra weight. </p>\r\n      <p><strong><font color=\"006666\">Ingredients</font></strong><br>\r\n        Calendula: Internal and topical use of calendula flowers for inflammation \r\n        of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa.

    <p><strong>Clinical study</strong></p>
    <p>One-hundred and forty-eight participants with varying degrees of male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) participated in an open-ended study using an all natural compound solution to determine the effects of hair re-growth. The participants were photographed and initial hair counts were done in a 2.5 cm diameter area of their balding scalp. After five months of treatment, the participants were re-photographed and hair counts were done on the same 2.5 cm diameter area of the scalp. The results indicate that 85.7% of the men in the study had an increase in their terminal hairs of 30% or greater. When evaluating the percent increase more closely, we find that we can break the data down into three separate groups.</p>
    <p>Showing significant re-growth was 40.8% of the study group who had an increase of 100% or greater (doubling, tripling, or more) of terminal hairs counted on their five month post-treatment photo as compared to their initial pre-treatment photo. Of this group, the highest increase of hairs was 472%, and the lowest increase was 102% with the mean at 193.7% increase of hairs.</p>
    <p>The group of men showing moderate re-growth, which we classed as 30%-100% increase in terminal hair re-growth, was 44.9% of the study group. The mean increase of that group was a 61.5% increase of hair re-growth.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the group, classed as no change, was 14.3% of the study group, with an average of 6.7% increase in re-growth</p>
    <p>Participants were told to use at least one bottle per month (five bottles in five months) but were allowed to use more if desired. We did not see any significant advantage to using more than one bottle per month. Our conclusion is that the stimulatory effect of the compound is achieved at the use rate of one bottle per month.</p>
    <p>The age range of the participants in their ability to restore hair growth was not a factor. The range of the participants in this study was 24-68 years old, with the average age being 38.7 years.</p>
    <p>In summary, this study concludes that the natural herbal extract solution has a stimulatory effect on restoring hair growth for at least 8 out of 10 men with androgenic alopecia (balding). The earlier stages of balding appear to respond to a higher degree, but significant improvement was seen in participants at all stages of baldness. There appears to be an optimum rate of use of the product, and age does not seem to be a factor in response.</p>
    <p>Although the qualitative and quantitative assessments were done independently, there was a strong correlation between the two groups. Overall, 88% of the qualitative group showed some degree of improvement. Of the group studied quantitatively, 85.7% showed a degree of re-growth (within 95% confidence limits). With the qualitative group, 6 of 50 men were categorized as having no change (category 0), representing 12% of the total. In the quantitative group (98 participants), 14 men, or 14.3% did not show any increase in hair counts. The average hair count increase for this group was 6.7%. So most subjects in this group did regrow some hair, but not a noticeable amount.</p>
    <p>The moderately improved qualitative group (category 1) consisted of 16 participants, or 32%. In the quantitatively studied group, 44 of 98 men fell into the range of +30% to +100%. This represents 44.9% of the men. The range of increase was 32% to 98%, with the mean at 61.5% The participants showing significant re-growth in the qualitative group (category 2) were 28 of 50, or 56%. In the quantitatively studied group, the number of men with significant re-growth (greater than 100%) was 40 of 98, or 40.8%. These men had hair count increases of 100% or more. The range of hair count increases was 102% to 472%, with a mean increase of 194%. The photograph of these men and women showed significant cosmetic changes which correlates very well with our quantitative findings.</p>
    <p>From the photos taken monthly during the course of the study, a pattern of re-growth was observed in those participants who demonstrated a significant increase in hair counts over the five months. The first countable hairs were seen after 10-12 weeks of treatment and were first detected on the crown or vertex of the head. Following further treatment, hair was then observed re-growing in the thinning or balding areas of the scalp. Hair re-growth in the fronto-temporal region of the scalp was noted after 16-20 weeks of treatment, and this region appeared to be the most resistant to re-growth to date.</p>
    <p>This open-ended study has demonstrated the hair re-growth response of 148 men who have been treated with an all natural compound solution applied topically to balding or thinning regions of the scalp. The treatment program included regular scalp cleansing with a natural extract scalp cleanser and application of at least 5-10 ml of the all natural compound solution at least twice daily. The data showed that hair counts increased significantly for approximately 85% of the participants in the five month period.</p>
    <p>The study methodology implies that the results obtained relate not only to the all natural compound solution used in the treatment, but also the overall treatment regimen. From previous minoxidil (Rogaine) papers, it was determined by them that a reasonable expectation for a &quot;placebo-type&quot; effect was a 10-15% increase in hair counts. Thus, by setting the cut-off in this study for moderate re-growth at a 30% increase, any increase due to a &quot;placebo-type&quot; effect is discounted.</p>
    <p>An attempt was made to correlate the response (either no change, moderate change, or significant change) with a number of factors. None of the factors studied gave a strong correlation, although there were some trends noted. The number of years of balding or thinning hair did not appear to have any correlation with the final results. However, it should be noted that the number of years thinning was a number given by the participants, and could not be verified accurately. Thus it is a subject of assessment and may not be very reliable. To help balance this uncertainty, the results were grouped. Regardless of the groupings used, there was no grouping which demonstrated a significant correlation with results.</p>
    <p>In terms of hair re-growth, this all natural compound solution appears to be more effective than minoxidil (Rogaine) and has no known side effects. A study by Alanis showed that a 2% minoxidil preparation applied topically increased hair counts by about 24% after 20 weeks. This study showed an increase of 89% in the same time period. Because of the differences in locating the measured regions of the scalp, these results are not directly comparable, but in a population study, Alanis's results showed that 34-46 out of 83 participants (48%) had no growth after 24 weeks, whereas our results show only 14 out of 98 (14%) had no growth after 20 weeks.</p>
    <p>Thus, our conclusion is that this product does stimulate re-growth of hair in cases of androgenic alopecia (balding), and that over 85% of men will respond favorably to the treatment. </p>

            </strong></font>Skin disorders are the most common pet ailments. The skin 
            is an important protective barrier for the body, and is responsible for 
            regulating temperature, producing pigment and vitamin D, eliminating toxins 
            and maintaining internal balance (homeostasis). A healthy animal has bright, 
            odorless hair and skin, free of debris, grease and irritation. Because 
            the skin has full contact with the environment, it is continuously exposed 
            to toxins in the form of pollutants, chemical products and infectious 
            agents. Poor nutrition, mineral and vitamin deficiencies, thyroid and 
            kidney disorders may also manifest via the skin. During the healing process 
            of skin diseases, skin eruptions or irritation may occur; this is normal 
            and is indicative of the cleaning process. Because so many different problems 
            are reflected by skin disorders, owners must pay close attention to the 
            cat's environment. The hair and skin surface must be carefully examined 
            for skin rash. The cat's living space (mattress, covers) should also be 
            examined, cleaned or changed if necessary. Herbs will be helpful in treating 
            conditions and improving nutrition and immune system.

    <p><strong>What Causes Hair Loss?</strong></p>
    <p>Hair loss and thinning hair have been sensitive issues for both men and women throughout time. Recently, medical science has identified the main cause of hair loss. It is now a known medical fact that hair loss stems from both genetic and hormonal causes.</p>
    <p>In the vast majority of cases, hair loss &ndash; in both men and women &ndash; is caused by a hormonal byproduct called DHT (dihydrotestostrone). Under the suppressive effects of DHT, the hair follicles become thinner and finer until the hair is permanently lost.</p>
    <p><strong>What treatments are available to fight hair loss?</strong></p>
    <p>Chemical Treaments</p>
    <p>Propecia&reg; is a FDA approved synthetic medication available only to men by prescription. It works by reducing DHT levels, however, Propecia&reg; although effective, may be associated with a wide range of side effects (including impotence) and cannot be used by women.</p>
    <p>Natural treatments</p>
    <p>Revivogen is a natural topical formula, which works through the same mechanism as Propecia&reg;. Revivogen is made with natural ingredients that have been scientifically proven to reduce DHT production. In fact, the active ingredients in Revivogen reduce DHT even more effectively than Propecia&reg;. In addition these ingredients prevent DHT's attachment to the hair follicle, which is not done by Propecia&reg;.</p>
    <p>By reducing DHT's production and its destructive effects on the hair follicle, the weakened and miniaturized hairs become thicker and stronger again, leading to a fuller and healthier head of hair. By targeting the cause of hair loss at the molecular level, Revivogen's powerful natural ingredients revitalize and protect the hair, blocking the androgen receptor and stimulating hair growth.</p>
    <p><strong>Indications and Usage</strong></p>
    <p>The Shampoo contains main active ingredients found in the topical formula and complements its activity but, is not as effective by itself. The Bio-Cleansing Shampoo gently cleanses the scalp and removes Sebum and DHT from the scalp. Important bio-active nutrients nourish, moisturize and improve the hair and scalp condition, creating a healthy environment for hair growth.</p>

            EGF Plus Rejuvenating Essential is a breakthrough in skin care. It contains 
            an unique human protein (EGF), which helps speed up epidermal cell renewal 
            and reduce fine wrinkles. The active ingredients, AHA, Glycerol and Keratin 
            also work to soften and moisturize leaving your skin looking younger and 
            healthier.</p>
          <P><font color="006666"><strong>What is EGF?</strong></font><br>
            EGF is a human polypeptide containing 53 amino acid residues that exhibit 
            potent mitogenic activity for a variety of cell types. EGF will bind to 
            the receptors on the cell surface before activating cell division. If 
            the receptors are saturated with EGF, no matter how much EGF is applied, 
            the excess EGF will not get into the cell. This cell regulating function 
            will prevent any excessive cell growth due to  prolonged exposure to the EFG molecule. 
            This molecule was first described by the 1986 Nobel Prize winner, American 
            Biochemist Stanley Cohen who isolated EGF from the sub maxillary glands 
            of adult mice (mEGF). With the advance of genetic engineering technology, 
            human EGF can now be produced in large quantities for medical use in treatment 
            of burn patients.</P>
          <P>As we age, the amount of EGF produced in our body decreases. This causes 
            the rate of regeneration of epidermal cells to slow down. EGF application 
            over time causes the skin to become smoother which results in improved skin tone, smaller pores and fewer fine wrinkles.</P>
          <P>(Leader gene Laboratory) has created a new breakthrough in skin care treatment 
            by DR. K. T. Tam, with a PhD in bio-engineering and a 30 year track record 
            in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Experiments conducted 
            by SGS had shown an average of 250% increase in the number of new epidermal 
            cells after continuous daily use of the gel for a month. </P>
          <P><STRONG><FONT color="006666">Dosage and directions</FONT></STRONG><BR>
            Apply twice daily in the morning and before bed time. Your skin will appear 
            younger and smoother after 28 days of continuous use. For best results
            EGF Plus Rejuvenating Essential skin care should be applied to face and neck 
            after a shower, facial scrubbing or face mask treatment. You can also 
            apply the gel on your hands. </P>

    <p><strong>What is conjunctivitis (pink eye) in cats?</strong></p>
    <p>Conjunctivitis (commonly called pink eye) is an inflammation of tissues around the eyes. It is a common condition in cats, dogs and even humans.</p>
    <p>Cat pink eye can has several possible causes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Infections </li>
        <li>External irritants (including eyelashes) </li>
        <li>Trauma (e.g. injury from a cat fight) </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your cat has pink eye, you may notice a discharge oozing from her eyes. The surrounding tissues may become swollen, inflamed and pink. Your might show obvious discomfort, but not necessarily.</p>

    </ul>

            Guggullipid Extract: Guggullipid Extract is derived from the Mokoul Myrrh 
            tree (Commiphora Mukul). In India, it is an approved treatment for hyperlipidemia. 
            Clinical studies indicate it to be effective in the treatment of high 
            cholesterol and triglyceride.</P>
          <p>Garcinia Cambogia Extract: This cholesterol lowering agent has been 
            shown to suppress both appetite and the formation of fats and cholesterol 
            in the liver. It also increases the LDL receptor activity in liver cells.</p>
          <p>Cassia Nomame: Cassia Nomame is a natural lipase inhibitor. Lipase inhibitors 
            interrupt the<br>
            normal sequence of events which normally occur after we eat a fat-containing 
            food. Lipase inhibitors keep the fat molecules in their original, large 
            state; therefore, they can't pass through the walls of the gastrointestinal 
            tract. They accomplish this by inhibiting the action of pancreatic lipases; 
            consequently, fat molecules are not digested in the small intestines & 
            they they do not enter the blood stream.</p>
          <p>Artichoke Powder: Artichoke has been historically used for many ailments: 
            to improve sluggish liver and increase bile secretion, for poor digestion, 
            atherosclerosis, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as kidney 
            diseases.</p>
          <p>Bromelain: Commercial bromelain has been reported to exert a wide variety 
            of pharmacological effects: digestive assistance, antiinflammatory activity, 
            burn debridement, prevention of swelling (edema), smooth muscle relaxation, 
            inhibition of blood platelet aggregation, enhancement of antibiotic absorption, 
            cancer treatment, ulcer prevention, sinusitis relief, appetite inhibition, 
            shortening of labor, and enhancement of wound healing.</p>
          <p>Ginger Extract: Ginger possesses numerous pharmacological properties, 
            the most relevant being its antioxidant effects; inhibition of prostaglandin, 
            thromboxane, and leukotriene synthesis; inhibition of platelet aggregation; 
            cholesterol-lowering actions; choleretic effects; cardiotonic effects; 
            gastrointestinal actions; thermogenic properties; and antibiotic activities.</p>
          <p>Reishi Mushroom: The reishi mushroom was rated number one on ancient 
            Chinese lists of superior medicines and touted as a substance that would 
            give one eternal youth and longevity. Reishi mushroom has long been used 
            to treat a variety of disorders and to promote vitality. This mushroom 
            is used to prevent high blood pressure and heart disease, to control and

    Kol-Aid - is a specially blended herbal formula that aids towards a long and healthy lifestyle.  Garcinia Cambogia, Cassia Nomame, Artichoke, Bromelain and other herbal ingredients are traditionally known to help balance cholesterol levels. Long-term use of these herbs has been shown to aid in balancing and lowering of LDL (the bad cholesterol) and increasing HDL (the good cholesterol).
    
    Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) are the "bad" cholesterol-
    they carry most of the cholesterol in the blood, which is the main source of buildup that damages and blocks the arteries. The more LDL-cholesterol you have, the greater the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). For optimum health your cholesterol level should be less than 5.0 mml/l.

    <p><strong>What is conjunctivitis (pink eye) in dogs?<br /></strong>Conjunctivitis - an inflammation of tissues around the eyes - is a common condition in dogs. Also known as &quot;Pink Eye&quot;, it's caused by infections, external irritants or trauma. Injuries (from accidents or dog fights) can cause it. </p>
    <p>If your dog has Pink Eye, it'll probably become obvious when a discharge starts oozing from his eye. The surrounding membranes can become swollen, inflamed and pink.</p>
    <p><strong>Common symptoms of canine pink eye</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive tears </li>
        <li>Apparent eye pain or itchiness </li>
        <li>Red or pink in the dog's eyes </li>
        <li>A pus-filled discharge often occurs </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Left untreated, dog conjunctivitis can in severe cases lead to blindness. But it is easily treated, so there is no reason for alarm.</p>
    <p><strong>Treating pink eye naturally<br /></strong>A blend of pure, natural herbal extracts, Eye Easy is highly effective in treating Pink Eye in dogs:</p>

    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word</strong>...<br />&quot;Our little dog Victor used to get reoccurring pink eye. He constantly had streaks of dark goop on his hair around his eyes.</p>
    <p>I was uncomfortable giving him the antibiotics from the vet all the time. He always seemed to need to take them. I decided to look for something that was more effective and better for Victor&rsquo;s system. </p>
    <p>Eye Easy is working great for him. His eyes are not gooey anymore. I also get to use the drops as soon as I notice his eyes acting up. Thank you for the great product.&quot; <br />&mdash;David J, California</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Customer Testimonial</span><br />&quot;Three weeks ago, my dog Sandy had a terrible case of pinkeye. It was gross to look at, and she kept trying to rub her eyes on everything and everybody. We needed help fast!</p>
    <p>A friend told me about Eye Easy, so I ordered some. Sandy almost seemed to enjoy it when I put the drops in her eyes. She quickly started to respond, and in a few days her eyes were 100% better! On your recommendation, I'm going to keep using it now and then as a preventative.

    <p><strong>Treating minor cat wounds and skin irritations</strong></p>
    <p>Outdoor cats are very prone to suffering minor wounds, especially from fighting other cats. </p>
    <p>If your cat suffers a minor injury, there's no need for undue alarm. It is, however, important to treat the wound quickly. If it becomes infected, healing becomes a longer and more painful process.</p>
    <p><strong>Traditional treatments</strong> (chemical antibiotics, corticosteroid creams, etc.) can work well for a while. But over the course of your cat's lifetime, traditional chemical treatments may have a negative affect on your cat's health:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Immune functioning may become compromised </li>
        <li>Some chemicals can be harmful if ingested (and it's difficult to stop your cat from licking her wounds) </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Feline First Aid Spray</strong> has none of these disadvantages. An all-natural herbal product, it's safe and non-toxic. At the same time, it's highly effective in treating minor cat wounds and skin problems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anti-fungal, anti-bacterial </li>
        <li>Prevents infection </li>
        <li>Repels insects </li>
        <li>Speeds healing </li>
        <li>Reduces pain </li>
        <li>Non-toxic, no harsh chemicals </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Also treats feline skin problems like &quot;hot spots&quot;</strong></p>
    <p>Cat skin irritation can be caused by allergies, insect bites, and assorted scrapes and scratches. Cats may excessively scratch the skin causing further irritation. Eventually the hair in the affected area can be torn out and the skin starts to bleed. An inflamed patch of skin may also ooze a clear or yellowish liquid. These are called hot spots, and can occur anywhere on the body.</p>
    <p><strong>Directions for use</strong></p>
    <p>Feline First Aid spray contains soothing aloe vera, plus a carefully-formulated blend of germ-fighting herbs. Applied to wounds or hot spots, it helps reduce pain, decrease healing time and prevent infection. </p>
    <p>Clean the wound as well as you can, dry it, then apply Feline First Aid Spray. It'll help your cat's wound heal quickly and safely, while relieving pain. It also keeps insects away, preventing them from contaminating the site of injury.</p>
    <p>Other recommended preventative measures include covering the affected area and clipping your pet's nails to minimize the ill affects of scratching.</p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word...</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;My cat and I thank you! Your antiseptic spray for cat wounds has truly improved the quality of her life. It seemed she was always getting skin infections, but now they're a thing of the past!&quot; Angela, Houston TX</p>

    <p><strong><br /></strong><strong>Keeping dogs active, mobile and pain free - Naturally.</strong><br />This unique formula combines a variety of natural nutrients to keep dogs active, mobile and pain free. The cornerstone nutrients, Chondroitin &amp; Glucosamine HCL, have demonstrated great success in naturally conditioning joints and enhancing comfort. Secondary nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin E, copper, zinc, selenium, manganese and numerous amino acids have been added for their enzymatic benefits and to assist in the transportation of Chondroitin &amp; Glucosamine to aching hips and joints. Vitamin C alone has been extensively used by many dog owners to help alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with canine hip displasia.<br /><br /><strong>Hips and Joints get damaged over time</strong><br />In normal joints the tips of the bones are soft and spongy and are floating in a gel-like fluid which acts as a cushion, keeping bone from touching bone. As dogs age, or if they exercise a lot, that cushion gets thinner and thinner. When the bones get close enough, or touch, the result is pain and discomfort which results in loss of mobility and stiffness. That's where Glucosamine HCL and Chondroitin come into play. These nutrients help condition and rebuild worn, aching joints.<br /><br /><strong>Easy Feeding, Delicious and Low in Fat</strong><br />Dogs don't like pills and powders. The conditioning nutrients in Hip Action are mixed into a tasty, all-natural base of real beef, durum wheat flour, fructose, apple, carrot and canola oil. Hip Action contains no preservatives and is naturally low in fat. Most important, dogs love the taste! The resealable bag keeps a 1 - 2 week supply of morsels fresh and delicious.<br /><br /><strong>Getting Results, Hip Action Morsels will benefit most dogs.</strong><br />The degree of discomfort varies from dog to dog as does the ability to provide relief. Increased comfort is typically achieved in 4 - 6 weeks of daily feeding. Owners are urged to pay close attention to their dog's condition because improvement in mobility is gradual. Getting the desired results may involve varying the amounts that are fed daily. Once the right amount has been established, dogs can remain active, healthy and happy. </p>
    <p><strong>Customer Testimonial</strong><br />Hello,<br />I just want to thank you so much for making your tasty treats. My pup Sierra- an 11 year old yorkie was beginning to ail a few years back- she has oscillating knee caps and it started to affect her hips and she wasn't able to run or jump without her legs giving out on her. One fine day my mom stumbled upon your fine Hip Action treats and we started to give Sierra one a day. Well now she is a rip-roaring running and jumping machine and her vet says she has the energy of a young pup. So here's a big thanks and you keep on keeping on and keep those tasty treats coming!!<br />All the best your pals- Jenny and her pup Sierra</p>

    <p><strong>Treating minor dog wounds</strong></p>
    <p>Dogs - especially active, outdoor dogs - are very prone to minor wounds from fighting, playing and exploring. </p>
    <p>Though not usually cause for alarm, it's important to treat these minor wounds so they don't become infected and turn a little problem into a difficult one.</p>
    <p>Traditional treatments (like chemical antibiotics and corticosteroid creams) may be effective in the short term. But in the long-term, traditional chemical treatments may adversely affect your dog's health:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, they may affect your dog's immune functioning </li>
        <li>Second, they can contain chemicals that are unhealthy if licked off </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Canine First Aid Spray</strong> is different. An all-natural herbal formulation, it is completely safe and non-toxic. Yet it is highly effective in treating minor wounds on dogs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anti-fungal, anti-bacterial </li>
        <li>Prevents infection </li>
        <li>Repels insects </li>
        <li>Speeds healing </li>
        <li>Reduces pain </li>
        <li>Non-toxic, no harsh chemicals </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions for use</strong></p>
    <p>Clean the cut or scratch as well as possible, dry it, then apply Canine First Aid Spray. It'll help your dog's wound heal quickly and safely, while relieving pain. It also keeps insects away, preventing them from contaminating the site of injury.</p>
    <p>Contains soothing aloe vera, plus a carefully-formulated blend of germ-fighting herbs. Order a bottle today!</p>
    <p><strong>Our customers have the last word...</strong></p>
    <p>&quot;My Black Lab had a wound on his leg that wasn't healing properly. I ordered some First Aid Spray and was very impressed.

    <p><strong>About Injured Paws on Cats</strong></p>
    <p> If your cat is limping, she may have an injured paw. </p>
    <p> Feline Heal-Care will help relieve your cat's discomfort, while cleaning infected paw wounds and promoting quick healing.</p>
    <p> Cats have protective pads on their feet. Especially for outdoor cats, these pads are subject to injury from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thorns</li>
        <li>Broken glass</li>
        <li>Slivers</li>
        <li>Sharp rocks</li>
        <li> Burs</li>
        <li>Hot pavement</li>
        <li>People stepping on them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>  Even indoor cats can suffer: household hazards like broken glass, pins and needles, or similar sharp objects can damage cat paws. </p>
    <p><strong> Symptoms of a bruised or injured cat paw:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Evident pain or distress</li>
        <li>Reluctance to put paw down and walk on it</li>
        <li>Red, swollen or warm-feeling pawpads </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your cat has a wounded paw, gently examine it carefully to see if there is a foreign object causing the distress. If there is and it can be easily removed, do so. Keep your cat calm and encourage her to rest. This will help keep the injury from getting worse and help speed healing.</p>
    <p><strong> Heal-Care for cat paw health</strong></p>
    <p>  Heal-Care is an all-natural ointment. Apply it directly to your cat's footpad: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loaded with Arnica and St John's Wort</li>
        <li>Reduces pain</li>
        <li>Cleans wounds</li>
        <li>Speeds the healing process</li>
        <li>Prevents cracking</li>
        <li>Keeps footpads healthy</li>
