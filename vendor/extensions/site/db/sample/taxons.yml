  footer: "<strong>Hair Loss Overview</strong><br>\r\n\
    It may start with a few extra hairs coming out as you brush, but eventually it progresses to noticeable thinning of your hair and bald spots on your scalp. These are the signs of hair loss, a problem that can cause a great deal of stress and self-consciousness for its sufferers. Hair loss may be most typically associated with men but, in fact, it can happen to anyone -- men, women, and children. It is estimated that more than half of men and women in the United States experience some degree of hair loss.\r\n\
    <p>Hairs are made up of a protein called keratin and consist of a shaft and follicle. The shaft is the part of the hair that we see above the skin while the follicle is located beneath the skin. At the base of each follicle is a bulb or bulge, which is the living part of the hair. Humans generally have about 100,000 hair follicles on their scalp, and typically shed approximately 100 hairs per day. This amount of hair loss is completely normal and natural. It is when daily shedding exceeds this amount that hair loss becomes visible and often troubling.</p>\r\n\
    <p>There are several different types of hair loss and many different causes. Loss of hair can occur in patches or all over the scalp. One of the most common forms of hair loss is known as androgenic alopecia, or pattern baldness. This type of baldness occurs more frequently in men, but affects women as well. While environmental factors to play a role in androgenic alopecia, genetics, age, and hormones are thought to be the main causes of this type of <a href=\"http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/men/general/081.html\" class=\"out\">hair loss</a>. Men who suffer from pattern baldness typically develop a receding hairline and thinning of hair on the crown, eventually leading to bald spots. Female pattern baldness, on the other hand, generally involves a more even thinning of the hair over the entire scalp, without a noticeably receding frontal hairline.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Hair loss can also be caused by a wide variety of illnesses and medical conditions. One condition, known as alopecia areata, is thought to be an autoimmune disease and results in patches of hair loss on the scalp and other parts of the body. Hair loss resulting from alopecia areata tends to be temporary although the hair may fall out and regrow a number of times. Other medical conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disorders, kidney disease, and lupus can also cause hair loss.</p>\r\n\
    <p>A number of medications cause hair loss as a side effect. Chemotherapy treatments used to fight cancer often cause hair loss, as do some diet pills and medications used to treat bipolar disorder. Poor nutrition and stress can also lead to excessive shedding of hair, as can certain nervous habits such as frequently pulling on one's hair. Certain hairstyles that pull tightly on the scalp can cause damage to hair follicles and hair loss after an extended period of time. Chemical hair treatments and excessive blow drying have also been known to result in higher than normal hair loss.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Many of these types of hair loss can be avoided or treated through certain adjustments or lifestyle changes. For example, if medication is the underlying cause, a doctor can often change or adjust the type or dosage of the medication in order to alleviate this side effect. Hair loss resulting from poor nutrition or medical conditions such as diabetes can often be stopped through nutritional and lifestyle improvements and by taking better control of one's health. Excessive shedding of hair stemming from hair styling choices can be simply resolved through the avoidance of the damaging hairstyles and treatments.</p>\r\n\
    <p>However, other types of baldness such as pattern baldness have typically been viewed as permanent forms of hair loss. Yet, for those who suffer from these types of hair loss there is still hope, as a number of different treatment options are available to help prevent future hair loss and to promote new hair growth.</p>\r\n\
    <p><strong>Medical Treatments</strong><br>\r\n\
    A number of different medical treatments are available to combat hair loss, including cortisone injections into the scalp and anthralin cream or ointment, which is applied to the scalp and washed off daily. However, two of the most effective medications in this regard are finasteride and minoxidil. Finasteride, or Propecia, is a prescription medication which inhibits the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by stopping its conversion from testosterone. DHT is a hormone that plays a significant role in male pattern baldness, as it causes hair follicles to shrink. The reduction of DHT levels by taking a daily dose of Propecia will slow hair loss and, in some cases, will even promote new hair growth. However, patients only receive these benefits as long as they continue to take Propecia. This particular medication is used only to treat hair loss in men, as it is not safe for women.</p>\r\n\
    <p>Minoxidil, the second medication known to be effective, is perhaps more commonly known as Rogaine. This hair growth stimulant was previously used as a treatment for high blood pressure and is now used to treat androgenic alopecia and alopecia areata in both men and women. Rogaine comes in liquid form and is rubbed on the scalp twice-daily. It is available as a two percent solution or as a five percent solution. This medication prevents further hair loss and often causes new growth. While new growth caused by Rogaine may be thinner and shorter than regular hair, it will blend in with other hair and help to cover bald spots. Rogaine or minoxidil is most effective at treating balding areas at the top and back of the scalp. As with Propecia, discontinued use of Rogaine will stop any new hair growth. Yet, while taking the medication, results can be quite significant, helping many hair loss sufferers to regain their confidence and to lessen the negative physical and emotional effects that result from excessive <a href=\"http://www.hairlosshelp.com/hair_loss_research/causes_hair_shedding.cfm\" class=\"out\">hair shedding</a> in some people. If either of these medical treatments appeals to you, talk to your physician to find out whether you are a good candidate to try Propecia or Rogaine.</p>\r\n\
    <p><strong>Natural Treatments</strong><br>\r\n\
    <a href=\"http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/revivogen-c4b1.cfm\">Revivogen</a> is a natural topical formula, which works through the same mechanism as Propecia\xC2\xAE. Revivogen is made with natural ingredients that have been scientifically proven to reduce DHT production. In fact, the active ingredients in Revivogen reduce DHT even more effectively than Propecia\xC2\xAE. In addition these ingredients prevent DHT's attachment to the hair follicle, which is not done by Propecia\xC2\xAE.</p>\r\n\
    <p>One of the best known herbal supplements that fight and reverse hair loss is <a href=\"http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/hair-growth-p34.cfm\">Hair Essentials</a>. Its unique formula is like a herbal vitamin; it restores the body\xE2\x80\x99s ability to grow new hair from within the scalp. This natural treatment is has had tremendous success with both men and women. Some positive side effects include less gray hair, and all around healthier looking hair. </p>\r\n\
    <p><strong>Surgery</strong><br>\r\n\
    Even when other types of hair loss treatment fail, there is still hope. Two types of surgical procedures are available to treat androgenic alopecia, scalp reduction surgery and <a href=\"http://www.hairtransplantnetwork.com/\" class=\"out\">hair transplants</a>. Scalp reduction surgery involves the removal of bald parts of the scalp. As skin is flexible, the remaining scalp can then be stretched to cover the removed areas with hair-covered skin. Hair transplants, on the other hand, involve the relocation or transplantation of hair follicles from an area where hair grows thickly on the scalp, such as at the back, to areas of baldness. Hair follicles from donor areas tend to be bald resistant and, as result, generally grow normally once transplanted. </p>\r\n\
    <p>This type of surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis. Sometimes, multiple sessions are required in order to achieve the best effect, and this is something that will be discussed between patient and surgeon prior to the procedure. Expectations and preferences are also discussed before hand. When deciding to undergo either of these two types of surgery, it is important to be sure that you choose a doctor who is a properly certified and experienced dermatologist, plastic surgeon, or cosmetic surgeon. A little bit of research on the part of the patient can lead to an improved experience and better results.</p>\r\n\
    <p>In recent years, the cost of this procedure has fallen while the quality of results has improved significantly. At times, a combination of scalp reduction and hair transplants are used to achieve a more natural look in those who have experienced more severe hair loss. With lowering costs and improved results, surgical treatments for hair loss are becoming more and more popular among those who are looking for a way to resolve and take control of their hair loss problem. So if you are suffering from baldness, rest assured that there are several treatment options available that could help you win the battle against hair loss.<br>\r\n\

    <strong>Acne Overview</strong><br>
    Acne is an affliction that plagues nearly everyone at least at some point in their life, although for some it is more severe and long-lasting than for others. While most common amongst teenagers, acne can also affect preteens and adults. No matter what your age though, <a href="http://www.acne.org/" class="out">acne</a> can be very upsetting, wreaking havoc with one's self-esteem and self-confidence.
    <p>Acne is a skin condition that causes outbreaks of various types of lesions which occur as a result of changes in the skin's pores. Pores consist of a hair follicle and an associated sebaceous gland, also known as an oil gland. These sebaceous glands produce an oil called sebum, which moistens the skin. When these glands produce too much oil, the pores become clogged and acne results. Pores can become clogged with dead skin and bacteria, as well as with the oil that they produce. </p>
    <p>Acne can manifest itself in a variety of forms. <a href="http://dermatology.about.com/cs/acnecomedones/a/comedones.htm" class="out">Whiteheads</a> are clogged pores which close and then protrude from the skin as a small bump, while blackheads are clogged pores which remain open, usually with a dark surface. Pimples are caused by an infection in a pore that results when dead skin and bacteria become trapped inside the area. Finally, cysts or nodules are lumps with a deeper source that can lead to a more serious infection. These occur when plugged pores open up deep beneath the skin.</p>
    <p>Outbreaks of acne tend to occur mostly on the face, neck, back, chest, and shoulders. While both males and females are affected by this condition, teenage boys are more prone to severe outbreaks of acne. This condition does not pose any serious health risk; however, it can lead to scarring and often has detrimental emotional and psychological effects, usually involving lowered self-confidence.</p>
    <p><strong>Teenage Acne</strong><br>
    Although a lucky few may go through their teenage years and the rest of their life never suffering from acne, or only the occasional lesion, this is unfortunately not the case for most people. Most of us will have to deal with this problem to some degree, some much more than others. While adults can also suffer from acne, it most commonly affects teenagers. The most prevalent type of acne that affects teens is called acne vulgaris, which is triggered by hormonal changes that occur with puberty. These changes cause an overproduction of oil in the sebaceous glands, leading to clogging and outbreaks of acne.</p>
    <p>Contrary to what some may believe, acne is not caused by uncleanliness. In fact, excessive cleaning or scrubbing of the skin can actually make acne worse. Gently washing one's face twice-daily with a mild cleanser should be sufficient to keep your skin clean. Also, studies have not found any link between certain types of food and acne. Again, this is contrary to popular and long-standing beliefs. However, if you are convinced that certain types of food trigger or increase the severity of your acne, it would be best to avoid those foods. Proper nutrition will not only help to promote your skin's health, but your overall health as well.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that acne has a significant social and emotional impact upon teenagers. It can greatly affect one's self-image, lowering self-confidence and self-esteem. It can also make people feel embarrassed and ashamed of their appearance. While suffering from acne is unpleasant and upsetting, it does not need to take over your life. No matter what type of lesion you most commonly experience, there are steps that can be taken to prevent or reduce the severity of acne, thereby lessening the negative impacts that this skin condition can have upon your daily life.</p>
    <p>As mentioned previously, the proper amount of daily washing can help to promote skin's health. For those with long hair it may help to keep your hair clean and away from your face in order to reduce the amount of oil transferred to your skin. For the same reason, it is also best to avoid touching your face, as the oil from your fingers will transfer to the skin of your face. Keeping hair spray and other hair products away from your face can also be helpful. Avoid wearing baseball caps or other hats if you find that they make your acne worse along your hairline. It is also advisable not to pick at or squeeze pimples or other lesions as doing so can lead to infection, scarring, and increased oil deposits on the skin.</p>
    <p>In addition to these basic steps, there are also many medical treatment options available. Over-the-counter treatments include soaps and cleansers. These products often contain an ingredient such as benzoyl peroxide which kills acne-causing bacteria and helps to remove dead skin which otherwise might lead to clogged pores. Some products contain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid" class="out">salicylic acid</a> which causes skin to flake away, opening up pores. When using any of these over-the-counter medications, be sure to follow the directions closely. It is also wise to test a small amount of the product on your skin in order to determine whether or not you will experience an allergic reaction.</p>
    <p>For acne that does not respond to over-the-counter remedies, certain prescription medications are also available. These can include antibiotics to fight acne-causing bacteria or retinoids, medications made from vitamin A that help to open up pores by causing skin to peel slightly. Certain new therapies are emerging as well, including some that employ light or zinc. If you suffer from moderate to severe acne, it is highly advisable to speak to a dermatologist. These physicians specialize in skin conditions and can assist you with finding the best treatment for you as an individual.</p>
    <p><strong>Acne and Makeup</strong><br>
    While seeking the proper treatment for your acne is important, there are also ways to hide or reduce the appearance of lesions through the use of makeup when you are suffering from an outbreak. Makeup can also be used to cover and conceal scars caused by acne lesions. However, it is very important to choose the right kind of makeup and to apply it correctly in order to achieve the desired effect. When selecting a type of makeup to use, be careful to choose one that will not trigger or aggravate your acne. To avoid such occurrences, be sure to select makeup that is noncomedogenic or nonacnegenic, which means that it will not clog pores and cause acne.</p>
    <p>Many types of cover-up products are available at local drugstores and should work well to improve the appearance of lesions and outbreaks while not causing or aggravating acne. With respect to foundations, powders are generally better for oily skin as they help to control the amount of oil on your face. Many companies also produce makeup for sensitive skin, which can be beneficial for those who suffer from acne and wish to protect their skin from any further irritation.</p>
    <p>Once you have selected the proper type of makeup, it is also important to apply it correctly. Improper or poor application can actually draw attention to lesions, scars, or blemishes rather than conceal them. In order to achieve the best effect with your makeup, be sure to use one that matches your skin tone as closely as possible. Foundations should be used to achieve an even skin tone, and concealers can also be used if added coverage is required.</p>
    <p>There is no need to suffer through uncontrolled acne and the negative effects that result from this condition. It is an incredibly widespread affliction, but by following a few simple treatment and makeup steps, the impact of acne upon your life can be greatly reduced, allowing you to enjoy and focus on other aspects of your life.<br>

    <h1>DHT blocker, dht blockers,amd dht inhibitors</h1>
      These hair loss products contain a natural yet extremely powerful anti-DHT formula 
      which acts as a dht blocker or dht inhibitor. The ingredients work through different 
      mechanisms to synergistically inhibit both type 1 and 2 forms of 5-Alpha Reductase 
      and decrease DHT locally. By decreasing the DHT levels, hair follicles can grow 
      and thicken naturally, leading to a fuller, healthier scalp without the side effects 
      associated with synthetic drugs. A DHT blocker inhibits the androgen receptors and 
      stimulates hair growth.<br>

    <strong>Herpes Overview </strong><br>
    Herpes is a type of viral infection caused by two different strains of the Herpes Simplex Virus -- Herpes Simplex Type 1 (HSV-1) and Herpes Simplex Type 2 (HSV-2). The herpes virus can manifest itself in two different forms, as oral herpes and as genital herpes. While either strain of the virus can cause both oral and genital herpes, generally HSV-1 is responsible for manifestations in the oral region while HSV-2 is responsible for manifestations in the genital region.
    <p>Herpes is spread through direct contact with an affected area, and occasionally through indirect contact. Both strains of the virus enter the body by traveling through breaks in the skin or mucous membranes. As a result, healthy skin often provides effective protection against transmission of the disease. However, skin abrasions only need to be tiny to allow the virus to travel into the body, and for mucous membranes even microscopic breaks provide a sufficient avenue for either strain of the virus to invade one's system.</p>
    <p>Once inside the body, the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/herpessimplex.html" class="out">Herpes Simplex Virus</a> can manifest itself through a variety of symptoms which tend to vary from individual to individual. Generally, the first sign of infection is a tingling sensation in the affected area. This feeling tends to be followed by the emergence of swollen and red bumps or sores on the skin. For oral herpes, the sores are called cold sores or fever blisters and occur in the lip and mouth region. For genital herpes, these bumps are referred to as genital sores and emerge below the waste in the genital area.</p>
    <p>These swollen areas usually become painful, especially when touched or moved. Eventually the sores will break or abscess, releasing a fluid full of the herpes virus. Several days after this occurrence the sores will begin to scab over and will heal over approximately seven to ten days. Outbreaks of these sores reoccur and are sometimes accompanied by other symptoms such as headaches and fatigue. As herpes attacks and engages the immune system, an infected person is also more susceptible to other viruses and infections.</p>
    <p>Both varieties of herpes, oral and genital, are incredibly widespread. It is estimated that oral herpes is present in between fifty to eighty percent of adults in the United States. For genital herpes, it is estimated that one in four American females and one in five American males suffer from this infection. As a result, it is important to know how to protect yourself and others from contracting the Herpes Simplex Virus. In addition, if already infected, knowing how to treat your symptoms and how to avoid or reduce the frequency of outbreaks will help to decrease discomfort and increase your quality of life.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Oral Herpes</strong><br>
    As mentioned previously, oral herpes is usually caused by Herpes Simplex Type 1. <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/463869" class="out">Prodromol symptoms</a> are characteristic of outbreaks of oral herpes. A prodome is an early symptom that is usually a precursor to a disease or onset of a disease attack. Such symptoms include fever, headaches, and fatigue. In the next stage of an outbreak of oral herpes, skin in the affected area begins to appear irritated. This is followed by the appearance of fluid-filled blisters or sores. While these most often appear on the lips and mouth area, especially at the corners of the mouth, they can appear anywhere on the face. After several days, the blisters will break and then begin to heal. Usually this does not result in any scarring.</p>
    <p>Oral herpes is spread by direct contact. In other words, the virus moves directly from the affected area to the area of contact. For example, if you have a cold sore on your mouth and you kiss someone, you can pass on the virus, giving oral herpes to the other person. While it is easiest to spread oral herpes during an outbreak when sores are present, the virus can also be spread when no symptoms are visible. It is also possible for people who do not even know that they have oral herpes to spread the virus. In such cases symptoms are usually so mild that they go unnoticed, or else the infected person just does not recognize their symptoms as being caused by herpes.</p>
    <p>There is currently no cure for oral herpes. However, there are steps and measures one can take in order to reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks. There are several antiviral medications available with prescriptions that can help to control outbreaks of oral herpes. These medications work by interfering with the virus and slowing its replication rate. While not eradicating the Herpes Simplex Virus, such drugs give one's immune system more of a chance to fight against the virus. </p>
    <p>Since it is thought that outbreaks of oral herpes may be triggered by stress and other factors which weaken the immune system, reducing stress and taking dietary supplements such as lysine may help to control outbreaks. Other dietary changes can also be helpful. For example, eating more dairy products and avoiding almonds and peanuts is thought to be beneficial. For specific measures to fit your individual needs, it is advisable to consult a physician in order to develop a plan which will best help you to control outbreaks of oral herpes, thereby increasing your comfort and quality of life.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Genital Herpes</strong><br>
    Genital herpes generally results from an infection of Type 2 of the Herpes Simplex Virus. Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection, usually spread by direct contact occurring during sexual activity. As with oral herpes, podromol symptoms are often precursors of outbreaks of genital herpes. Itching and irritation first occurs in the affected area, followed by the appearance of small, and often painful, fluid-filled sores in the anal and genital region. Occasionally, these sores will also appear on the upper, inner thigh and buttocks. After draining, these sores will form a scab, eventually healing and disappearing without leaving any scarring. Outbreaks of genital herpes can also include additional symptoms such as aching in the affected area, discharge from the vagina or penis, and a burning sensation or other discomfort when urinating. Initial outbreaks of genital herpes are generally more severe than subsequent outbreaks, which tend to occur approximately four or five times a year.</p>
    <p>There are a number of steps that can be taken to prevent transmission of genital herpes and to control outbreaks. First of all, it is important to protect your partner by using latex condoms during sex. It is also highly advisable to avoid sexual activity during times of active infection such as during or prior to an outbreak. In order to avoid self infection to other areas of your body, it is best not to touch any of the sores that appear as a result of an outbreak. If you do touch a sore, promptly wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</p>
    <p>For relief of symptoms and to encourage healing, a variety of topical ointments may be helpful, such as ointments containing zinc or aloe. Also, as with oral herpes, taking a daily lysine supplement may reduce the frequency of outbreaks. It may also speed up the healing process when outbreaks do occur. Again, however, it is always a good idea to consult with a health practitioner in order to find the best way for you as an individual to treat and deal with genital herpes and its symptoms.<br>

    <strong>Low Libido Overview</strong><br>
    Low libido, or <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relationships/facts/lackingsexdrive.htm" class="out">low sex drive</a> or sexual desire, is a common condition affecting many people around the world. It can be caused by a variety of different factors, both physical and psychological. Low libido decreases a person's desire for sex and interferes with their ability to perform during sexual intercourse. This condition affects both men and women on a surprisingly wide scale. Low libido on the part of one partner can cause much frustration, tension, and anguish in marriages and other relationships. However, many people who suffer from this condition are too ashamed or embarrassed to seek help. Yet, after pinpointing the probable cause or causes of low libido in an individual, the problem can often be overcome. As a result, it is very beneficial to know about the various causes of and treatment for low sexual desire.
    <p>As already mentioned, low libido can result from a multitude of different causes. Psychological factors frequently inhibit sexual desire, including emotional trauma and past abuse. Conflict or confusion over one's sexual orientation can decrease sex drive, as can anger, depression, stress, and conflict in relationships. An incredibly long list of physical factors can also affect levels of sexual desire in both men and women. Such physical causes range from low amounts of certain hormones, medical conditions, and the use of some drugs and pharmaceuticals.</p>
    <p>Weight problems are one physical factor that can lead to low libido. This is true for both ends of the weight problem spectrum, including obesity and anorexia. Low libido resulting from being either over or under weight can often be resolved by addressing the weight problem. Generally, once an individual reaches a more average, healthy weight low libido will no longer be a problem. Certain diseases and physical conditions can also lead to decreased sexual desire. Some such conditions include diabetes, arthritis, anemia, and cardiovascular disease. </p>
    <p>Often, low libido occurs as a side effect of various medications. For example, <a href="http://www.healthyplace.com/communities/depression/treatment/antidepressants/ssri.asp" class="out">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a> (SSRIs), a class of antidepressants, have been linked to decreased sex drive in some individuals. If this is the case, sometimes an adjustment or change of medication can help to alleviate the problem. Abuse of certain illegal substances, such as marijuana, heroine, and cocaine, can also inhibit sexual desire, as can abuse of alcohol. While in certain cases low libido may be incurable, often the problem can be overcome with relative ease.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Female Low Libido</strong><br>
    While both men and <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/female-libido-c10s25.cfm">women suffer from low libido</a>, the causes and treatments are not always the same, although many overlap. Approximately twice as many women as men suffer from low libido and it has significant impact upon the lives and relationships of those whom it affects. While the above mentioned causes of decreased sexual desire apply to women, there are also several factors and triggers which are specific to females and female low libido.</p>
    <p>For example, in the case of medications, birth control pills can sometimes be the culprit when it comes to female low libido. These contraceptive medications cause hormonal changes and adjustments within the female body, which can then interfere with a woman's sexual desire. Unfortunately, lowered female sex drive can also result from a hysterectomy. Menopause can also affect a female's sexual desire in a number of ways. Estrogen therapies used to treat and control symptoms such as hot flashes in menopausal women sometimes trigger low libido. Also, the physical changes that occur in this stage of a woman's life can also have a direct effect on levels of sexual desire. For instance, the lessening of natural lubrication and elasticity of the vagina that occurs with age can make sexual intercourse uncomfortable or painful for some women. The anticipation of this pain then leads to tension and decreased sex drive.</p>
    <p>Deciding what to do about a female's low libido depends on identifying the cause or trigger of the decreased sex drive. Once the cause of the problem is known, there are steps that can be taken to improve the situation in most cases. When female low libido is caused by <a href="http://www.womenshealthchannel.com/contraception/hormonal.shtml" class="out">hormonal contraceptives</a> or estrogen therapies, changes or adjustments to these medications under the supervision of a physician will likely improve or even eliminate the problem. Sometimes certain medications or hormone supplements can improve sexual desire, especially when a woman is suffering from low androgen levels. Lack of natural lubrication or soreness in the vagina can often be overcome through the use of a lubricant or an estrogen vaginal cream.</p>
    <p>Women can also overcome low libido in some cases by making certain lifestyle changes. For example, when decreased sexual desire is caused by stress, conflict, or fatigue, taking steps to reduce these factors can be of great help in returning one's sexual desire back to a normal level. Women who are suffering from low libido should not be embarrassed or afraid to talk to their doctor. In fact, raising the subject with a qualified professional is often a major first step on the road to eradicating low libido.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Male Low Libido</strong><br>
    Male low libido is a problem that afflicts many men, detracting from their peace of mind and quality of relationships. <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/male-libido-c10s24.cfm">Decreased sexual desire in men</a> is a source of many negative emotions, including feelings of inadequacy. Many of the common causes of low libido lead to decreased sex drive in men, including depression, stress, substance abuse, and medical conditions such as diabetes. At the same time, there are certain factors which are more frequently associated with male low libido than with female low libido.</p>
    <p>While low levels of testosterone are also a cause of decreased sex drive in females, it is one of the most common factors with regards to male low libido. As they age, men go through a medical phenomenon known as andropause. Similar to how menopause leads to the decrease in estrogen in women, andropause leads to the decrease in testosterone in men. This change takes place slowly over time, is mostly unobvious, and generally affects men around age forty to fifty-five. While this transition can result in decreased energy and physical agility, it can also trigger low libido. Certain medications can be prescribed to combat male low libido, and a physician should be consulted in order to decide whether or not this is the best course of action in an individual case.</p>
    <p>Men are also susceptible to psychologically induced low sexual desire, as are women. However, certain psychological causes or situations may be more common among men, although not exclusive to men. For example, low libido sometimes stems from a desire to control or punish one's spouse or partner. A low sex drive can occasionally give a man a feeling of power over his spouse or partner as it allows him to detach himself from the intimacy or sexual activity.</p>
    <p>Removing psychological barriers to increased sex drive can often be achieved through counseling or even just through improving communication between partners. Eliminating stressors and conflict also go a long way to improving psychologically-based low libido. Proper diet, exercise, and sufficient sleep are also important. Quitting smoking and moderating alcohol intake can also be very beneficial. If you are suffering from low libido, whether male or female, it is very important to consult a physician in case this problem is a result of a serious medical condition that requires attention. In relationships, honesty, understanding, and communication go a long way when trying to overcome male or female low libido.<br>

    <h1>The science of body hair</h1>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair" class="out">Human hairs</a> are made up of two separate structures -- the follicle beneath the surface of the skin and the shaft, which is the part we see. The &quot;bulb&quot; or &quot;bulge&quot; is located at the base of the follicle and is the living part of the hair. The main component of hair is keratin, a form of hard protein. </p>
    <p>Human body hair comes in two main types -- vellus hair and terminal hair. Vellus hair, also referred to as &quot;peach fuzz,&quot; is a very soft and short type of hair that grows on most parts of both the male and female human body. Vellus hairs generally do not grow more than 2 cm in length and are not attached to <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066499/sebaceous-gland" class="out">sebaceous glands</a>, which are found in the skin of humans and other mammals. Terminal hair, on the other hand, tends to be longer, darker, and coarser than vellus hair. During puberty the rising level of androgens causes some vellus hair to transform into terminal hair, most often in areas such as the under arms, genital areas, legs, and forearms. In addition, mostly for men, terminal hair can grow on the face, back, chest, and shoulders. Women are generally most concerned with removing hair from the eyebrows, armpits, legs, and bikini area while men mostly concentrate on hair removal from the face and shoulders.</p>
    <p><strong>Electrolysis hair removal</strong><br>
    Electrolysis is a form of permanent hair removal that uses electricity. During the process of electrolysis, a qualified practitioner inserts a fine metal probe into the hair follicle, delivering an electric current which destroys the area that generates the hair. Tweezers are then used to remove the loosened hair, and the process is repeated for each individual hair. While electrolysis is the most permanent form of hair removal available, a number of treatments are usually required. This is because some hairs may be missed or may be in their dormant stage during any given treatment session. Also, electrolysis treatments should be administered carefully in order to avoid dangers such as electric shock, excessive pain, infection, and scarring. While it is costly and time-consuming, when carried out properly <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/electrolysis-hair-removal-c2s44.cfm">home electrolysis</a> can provide effective, permanent hair removal. </p>
    <p><strong>Epilators</strong><br>
      <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/epilators-hair-removal-c2s58.cfm">Epilators</a> are mechanical devices consisting of a coiled spring or rubber roller that catches or grasps multiple hairs and pulls them out of the skin. This form of hair removal works particularly well on arms and legs and its effect can last from several days to several weeks. However, the use of these tools is somewhat restricted. This is due to the fact that hair must be between one-quarter of an inch and one third of an inch long in order for epilators to work. In addition, the use of epilators can be quite painful for some people, especially in sensitive areas. Pulling hairs out by the roots in this fashion can also lead to ingrown hairs and irritated skin. Sometimes it is beneficial to undergo a waxing treatment prior to attempting to use epilators in order to reduce the likelihood of such occurrences. </p>
    <p><strong>Hair growth inhibitors</strong><br>
      <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/hair-inhibitors-c2s6.cfm">Hair growth inhibitors</a> are pharmaceuticals designed to reduce hair by retarding or inhibiting hair's growth. Hair growth inhibitors are available as oral medications and topical preparations, some of which require a prescription from your doctor. With continued use, hair growth inhibitors can provide long-lasting or permanent hair reduction, although these products are more effective for some people than others. Even for over-the-counter brands, it is usually best to consult a physician before using hair growth inhibitors as some are only safe for certain people, or may cause unwanted side effects.</p>
    <p><strong>Hair removal creams / depilatories</strong><br>
    Hair removal creams, also known as <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/hair-removal-creams-c2s17.cfm">depilatories</a>, are products which chemically dissolve hair, allowing it to be easily scraped or brushed off the skin. These creams come in several forms, including lotions, gels, aerosols, and roll-on products. Hair removal through the use of depilatories is usually effective for approximately two to five days. Hair removal creams are inexpensive, can be employed at home, and are fast to use. However, these products can also cause skin irritation and often leave a visible shadow of hair beneath the skin of dark-haired people. Some people also find the odor of depilatories very unpleasant. Those with particularly sensitive skin should be cautious when using hair removal creams and everyone should be sure to pay careful attention to any directions accompanying this type of product.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingrown hair treatments</strong><br>
    Ingrown hairs occur when a hair is broken off beneath the skin and begins to grow at an angle instead of up through the skin. They appear as little red bumps on the skin and can cause irritation and an unsightly rash. Sometimes a small, sterilized needle can be used to free the hair. Otherwise, <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/ingrown-hair-treatment-p67.cfm">solutions containing salicylic acid</a> can be used to treat this problem. Products containing salicylic acid act as exfoliants and target these troublesome follicles, freeing them from beneath the skin. Many of these ingrown hair treatments are safe for both men and women to use on many parts of the body. </p>
    <p><strong>Laser hair removal</strong><br>
    Laser hair removal is a permanent form of hair reduction, the effectiveness of which varies from person to person. Often, follow-up treatments are necessary in order to achieve the best results. Three to six sessions are generally required, although at times even more treatments are needed. During this type of treatment, lasers generally target hair follicles, damaging them while leaving the rest of the skin intact. Laser hair removal is considered to be a safe procedure when performed properly by a qualified practitioner. It is particularly useful for large areas such as legs and backs. In addition, this form of hair removal has proved most effective for fair skinned people with dark hair, as the lasers often target the pigmented part of the hair follicle. The disadvantages of laser hair removal are that it can be painful, it tends to be expensive, and improper treatments can cause burns, skin discoloration, and patchy regrowth. When planning to undergo this type of treatment, it is important to make sure that your practitioner is experienced and qualified.</p>
    <p><strong>Plucking</strong><br>
    Plucking is a form of hair removal that involves pulling or plucking hairs out by the roots, one at a time, using fingers or tweezers. This method of hair removal is often used for eyebrows and other facial hair, and generally lasts for approximately three weeks. Plucking is a cheap form of hair removal that is particularly useful for removing small numbers of stray hairs. Be sure to sterilize your tweezers before using them to remove hairs in this fashion. Ingrown hairs can be caused by plucking, as can pitting and scarring. Plucking can be painful and should not be used on nose hairs in order to avoid dangerous infections. </p>
    <p><strong>Shaving</strong><br>
    Shaving involves using a sharp metal blade to remove hair by cutting it off at the skin's surface. This can be done either manually or with an electric razor. This method tends to be effective for body hair for approximately four days. Shaving is a fast, inexpensive, and safe way to <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_290_remove-unsightly-body.html" class="out">remove body hair</a> at home. At the same time, care must be taken to avoid cuts, skin irritation, and ingrown hairs. For sensitive areas, it is sometimes helpful to shave in the direction of hair growth in order to minimize such problems. In addition, changing blades regularly is beneficial in this regard. Lathering and soaking the skin prior to shaving is also a good idea and will reduce the likelihood of irritating problems.</p>
    <p><strong>Sugaring</strong><br>
    Sugaring, sometimes referred to as <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/hair-removal-sugaring-c2s35.cfm">Persian waxing</a>, is a hair removal method that has been used for thousands of years. It involves the application of a sticky, sugary paste to the skin. A strip of paper or porous cloth is then pressed into the preparation. The strip is pulled quickly away from the skin, opposite to the direction of hair growth, removing the hairs with it. Sugaring typically lasts for about three to six weeks and is an inexpensive form of hair removal that can easily be done at home. It can be a messy undertaking, however, and can cause hairs to break off below the skin's surface.</p>
    <p><strong>Waxing</strong><br>
      <a href="http://www.naturalwellbeing.com/hair-removal-waxing-c2s36.cfm">Waxing</a> is a form of hair removal very similar to sugaring. For this method, a layer of wax is applied to the skin and quickly removed using a strip of cloth or paper. This not only pulls hairs out by their roots, it also removes dead skin. As a result, waxing is a very effective form of temporary hair removal that leaves the skin smooth and generally lasts for three to eight weeks. It can be used on nearly any part of the body, including the eyebrows, face, legs, abdomen, and bikini area. Waxing can be carried out either on your own at home or by a qualified cosmetologist or esthetician. Repeated use of waxing often results in slower hair regrowth and, at times, the destruction of some hair roots. Eventually, this may lead to permanent hair reduction. Waxing is a fast and inexpensive hair removal method but, as with sugaring, it can be messy and can result in ingrown hairs and irritation. Exfoliating regularly and applying a solution of astringent and oil can greatly reduce the occurrence of these problems.</p>
